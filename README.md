## NCES Scraping Project

This is a webscraping project written and devloped by James McGillicuddy for the sole use of Eduoporium.

The majority of the code for this project is found in the main_modules directory, please start [here](./main_modules/README.md).

After spending many many hours staring at school websites, a pattern emerged between many of their staff directories. Many had the same pagination system that I dubbed 'fs' due to that prefix being common in their html structure ([example](https://www.pvbears.org//our-district/staff-directory)). I'm not sure what exactly the fs stands for or what service all of these school pages got them from (my googling led to many results for the US Forest Service), but they represented a great opportunity.
