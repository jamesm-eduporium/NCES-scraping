Open Enrollment





What is open enrollment?
Open enrollment refers to the process of applying to a school zoned for an address other than the physical address in which the student currently resides, also referred to as an “out-of-zone” school. The open enrollment process is designed to give parents an option to choose from schools that may more closely align with the needs of their child or children. 
Who can participate in open enrollment?
Any Richmond City resident, including students who do not currently attend Richmond Public Schools, may apply to schools for grades K through 12 via open enrollment.
How does the open enrollment lottery work?
Families submit open enrollment applications in Enroll RPS (www.attendrvaschools.com) by providing basic information about their child and indicating their school selections. Applications are reviewed for eligibility before being entered into the lottery system.
A randomized lottery algorithm determines the rank order of students for each school and grade level. If seats are available, students receiving seats receive an email notification and have ten (10) business days to accept or decline the seat. Students who do not receive a seat are automatically placed on a waiting list. If a seat becomes available after the initial lottery run, notifications are sent via email. 
My child attends a school through a previous open enrollment lottery. Do they need to reapply?
No. Students who are already enrolled at an RPS school via a previous year's open enrollment lottery do not need to reapply to attend that school next year, or for any additional year within the school's grade range (i.e., grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12).
How many schools can I apply to? 
Families may apply for up to three schools through open enrollment. (There is no limit to the number of specialty schools and /or governor's schools to which a student may apply. Students may only apply to specialty schools for which they are eligible). Families may also apply to Patrick Henry School of Science and Arts in addition to open enrollment choices, if eligible (grades K-5).
What school zone do I live in?
Each residence in the city of Richmond has a zone school at the elementary (K-5), middle (6-8), and high school (9-12) level. Your zone school is based upon the physical address where you live. Visit our school locator to use your address to identify your current zone schools.
Information about RPS's residency policy is available on our Board Docs website. 
Can I apply to comprehensive high schools via open enrollment?
Yes. Students who will be in high school in school year 2024-2025 can apply to attend a comprehensive high school other than their zone school via open enrollment.
How are siblings prioritized in the open enrollment lottery?
When applying to the lottery, siblings must be submitted as separate lottery entries. There may be instances where one sibling is admitted to an out-of-zone school and the other sibling is not. However, twins or multiple births are prioritized together in their lottery entries (separate applications must be submitted) such that if one twin receives a seat, the other will also.
Students whose sibling(s) attend an out-of-zone school via open enrollment from a previous year are prioritized in the lottery. Admission for the sibling who is new to the out-of-zone school will be contingent on available space at the requested school at the requested grade level. Additionally, the already enrolled student must remain enrolled for the application year. For example, a rising kindergarten student whose sibling is a 5th grader attending an out-of-zone elementary school will not be prioritized in the lottery, as their older sibling will move to middle school the following year.
When does the open enrollment application window close?
Open enrollment applications for school year 2024-2025 must be submitted in Enroll RPS (www.attendrvaschools.com) by Thursday February 1, 2024 at 4:30 PM.
I am an RPS employee and want my child to attend an out-of-zone school. What are my next steps?
Richmond School Board Policy 8-2.6 states that parents or guardians of dependent children who are full-time employees of RPS and do not live in Richmond City may enroll their child in an RPS school after RPS has met all local, state, and federal requirements regarding the enrollment of resident children, including exhausting all open enrollment options first.
Parents or guardians of dependent children who are full-time employees of RPS and do live in Richmond City must enter the open enrollment process as any other Richmond resident student.
The full text of this policy is below:
"Subject to the approval of the division superintendent or his/her designee, parents or guardians of dependent children who are full-time employees of Richmond Public Schools and who are not residents of the City of Richmond may enroll their children in Richmond Public Schools on a tuition waived basis, subject to the availability of space, as determined after Richmond Public Schools has met all local, state and federal requirements regarding the enrollment of resident children, including fully exhausting all open enrollment options. This shall not be deemed to include alternative public school programs for which Richmond Public Schools is assessed per pupil tuition. Any children of an employee attending a Richmond Public Schools facility through placement made prior to January 4, 2010, may continue in that placement through the terminal grade offered at that school.
Parents or guardians of dependent children who are full-time employees of Richmond Public Schools seeking enrollment in an out-of-zone school with limited space availability and who are residents of the City of Richmond will be entered into the open enrollment process as any other student who parents are residents of the city would do, or, in the case of specialty or alternative programs, enter the prescribed admissions process for that placement."
How do I accept a seat offer? 
If your child was offered a seat for a particular school, the status row will read "Offered Placement". Additionally, you will see "Accept Seat" or "Decline Seat" buttons that will allow you to indicate your decision. To accept a seat, simply click "Accept Seat".
My child received multiple seat offers. Can I accept more than one?
No. Students can only accept one seat offer; however, students may elect to remain on the waitlist at multiple schools. The decision to accept an initial seat offer will not remove a student from other waitlists, or decline any pending offers, but will automatically decline any previously accepted seats. 
What if my child is not offered a seat at any school for which they applied?
If a student is not offered a seat at any school for which they applied (either via the open enrollment lottery or through the specialty school application process), the student must attend their zone school.
If I receive an offer from the waitlist, what are my next steps?
If you were originally on a waitlist but later receive a seat offer, you may accept that seat offer by logging into the Enroll RPS portal and selecting "Accept Placement". Doing so will decline any previously accepted offer, if applicable.
I was waitlisted last year at the school of my choice. Do I need to reapply?
Yes. If you would like for your child to attend an out-of-zone school, and you did not accept a seat offer for the current school year, you must reapply for school year 2024-2025. Waitlists do not carry over year to year.
Is transportation provided if my child accepts an open enrollment seat?
Transportation is not provided for students attending a school through open enrollment. Transportation for students admitted to RPS specialty schools or regional governor's schools receive transportation through a hub system, except for Open High School.






Specialty Schools





What RPS schools are considered specialty schools and have an application process for admission?
Applications must be completed to the following schools:

Franklin Military Academy (rising 6th through 12th grade students may apply)
Open High School (rising 9th and 10th grade students may apply)
Richmond Community High School (rising 9th and 10th grade students may apply)
The IB Diploma Programme at Thomas Jefferson HS (rising 11th grade students may apply)

The Governor's STEM Academy at Richmond Technical Center (rising 9th grade students may apply) has previously had a selective application process but will move to a lottery system. Students must submit a statement of interest to be entered into the lottery and must attend an RPS high school.

Who can submit specialty school applications?
Any Richmond City resident, including students who do not currently attend Richmond Public Schools, may apply to schools via the specialty school application process.
What are the components of the specialty school application?
RPS now has a common application, which includes grade point average (calculated internally), writing (completed in person beginning SY 2024-25), an in-person interview, and two teacher recommendations.
My child attends a specialty school through a prior year application. Do they need to reapply?
No. Students who are already enrolled at an RPS specialty school via a previous year's application process do not need to reapply to attend that school next year. However, Franklin Military Academy 8th graders wishing to continue at Franklin Military Academy must apply to 9th grade to remain there.
How many schools can I apply to?
There is no limit to the number of specialty schools to which a student may apply, though students may only apply to specialty schools for which they are eligible.
When will results be available for applications submitted for SY2024-2025?
Results will be posted on Enroll RPS during the afternoon of Friday March 1, 2024. 
How do I accept a seat offer? 
If your child was offered a seat for a particular school, the status row will read "Offered Placement". Additionally, you will see "Accept Seat" or "Decline Seat" buttons that will allow you to indicate your decision. To accept a seat, simply click "Accept Seat".
My child received multiple seat offers. Can I accept more than one?
No. Students can only accept one seat offer; however, students may elect to remain on the waitlist at multiple schools. The decision to accept an initial seat offer will not remove a student from other waitlists.
Is transportation provided if my child accepts a specialty school seat?
Yes. Transportation for students admitted to RPS specialty schools or regional governor's schools receive transportation through a hub system. Though Open High School has not been included in the hub system in the past, next year it will. Additionally, all RPS high school students are eligible to receive a free GRTC bus pass.
What if my child is not offered a seat at any school for which they applied?
If a student is not offered a seat at any school, they may be placed on a waitlist. Their movement on the waitlist will depend on their current school and their ED status. If no seat is offered by the last day of the first week of school (for RPS specialty schools) or by the end of the first semester (for regional governor’s schools), the student will only be eligible to attend their zoned school for the 2024-25 school year.
How does the waitlist work for specialty schools?
Students on the waitlist at Franklin Military Academy receive seat offers if/as they become available according to their waitlist rank, which is based on their final application composite score.

For Open High School and Richmond Community High School, initial seat offers were filled following the three selection phases approved by the Richmond Public Schools School Board on September 18, 2023. Any vacant seats that open due to declined seat offers will be filled following the same selection process of phases 1, 2, and 3, to maintain the integrity of the new selection rules for the entirety of the application year.
If I receive an offer from the waitlist, what are my next steps?
If a student was originally on a waitlist but later receives a seat offer, they may accept that seat by logging into the Enroll RPS portal and selecting "Accept Placement." Doing so will decline any previously accepted offers, if applicable. Families will receive an email notifying them of any changes to their student's waitlist status and will have 10 business days to make an acceptance decision from the date of receiving the email.
Can I appeal a specialty school decision?
Yes. If you wish to file an appeal to a specialty school application decision, you may do so by first contacting the principal of the specific school. Appeal requests must be shared with the appropriate school team in writing (via email or otherwise) no later than 4:30 pm on Friday, March 15. Appeals may be made only on application process-related grounds.

Below are the scheduled Evaluation Days for this application season followed by general information about in-person evaluation days. More school-specific information will be shared with applicants closer to each school's Evaluation Day.
Appomattox Regional Governor's School -
Sat, January 13, 2024; Sat. January 20, 2024
Franklin Military Academy -
Sat. January 13 (HS applicants); Sat. January 20 (MS Applicants)

Richmond Community High School - 
Tue-Thu February 13-15
Tue-Thu February 20-22

How will the interview and writing process be communicated to students and families?
After the conclusion of the application submission window, eligible applicants will receive a message from the schools to which they applied detailing next steps in the application process, the in-person ‘evaluation day’. 
Each school’s evaluation day details email will provide information about what to expect, including:

Arrival information (parking and related transportation details)
Sign-in procedures and instructions for families
Interview portion overview
Writing portion overview
Contact information for questions and rescheduling

Will transportation be provided to in-person days?
Yes. RPS is committed to providing transportation to in-person evaluation days for specialty schools for families who need it. Families will need to respond to a questionnaire regarding their need for transportation prior to the interview date for their respective school so that transportation can be arranged. Messages will be sent via Enroll RPS to all applicants to schools with in person evaluation days.
If a student misses their evaluation day, will make-up days be available?
This will depend on the communication between the applicant's family and the relevant school. School teams will make every effort to ensure all applicants complete their evaluation day components. However, if a student fails to attend their evaluation day without prior notice those elements will be scored as zeros (the student will still remain in the applicant pool).
How will students receive accommodations? 
RPS student accommodations will be provided as they are identified on our student information system. Non-RPS students must schedule an appointment with the Child Find team or their relevant public school counselor and provide an ISP (Individualized Service Plan) signed by their provider on school letterhead if they do not have an accommodation. If an accommodation is named on the day of the evaluation and not already identified on an existing and active IEP or 504 plan, it cannot be provided until verified by an active IEP or 504.
