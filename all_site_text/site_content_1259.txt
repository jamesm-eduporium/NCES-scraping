All required enrollment steps, including completing the online form and providing documentation, must be completed before a child starts school. If you need in-person support, please reach out to your new school to make an appointment.
For families who speak a language other than English at home or in addition to English, please reach out to our Welcome Center to check eligibility for English Learner (EL) services. Contact the Welcome Center at 804-230-2980 or via email at welcomecenter@rvaschools.net.

Frequently Asked Questions





Below are frequently asked questions pertaining to enrollment. If you have additional questions, please email enrollrps@rvaschools.net.
My child already attends an RPS School. Do I need to enroll again?
No. Current RPS students do not have to enroll each year, except for preschool students who must enroll in kindergarten.
What school zone do I live in?
Each residence in the city of Richmond has a zoned school at the elementary (K-5), middle (6-8), and high school (9-12) levels.  School zones are based upon the physical address where that student lives. Locate your child's school by address.
What documents do I need to provide when enrolling my child?
You will need your child’s original birth certificate (or a certified copy), immunization record, and proof of a physical (within the last 12 months). Parents must provide two proofs of city residency per Richmond School Board Policy 8-2.2 (more information about acceptable documents is below). For preschool enrollment, proof of income is also required.
These documents are not required to complete the online enrollment form, but will be required before you complete the process. If you do not have access to these documents when completing online enrollment, you will need to upload them at a later date or bring the documents to the school in person by making an appointment. For next steps with enrollment, please reach out to your students' new school. 
The birth certificate (or certified copy) must be provided in person. Upon completion of your online enrollment form, someone from your school will contact you to schedule an appointment to bring this document.
What counts as a proof of residency document?
Per School Board Policy 8-2.2, acceptable forms of proof of residence shall include, but not be limited to, two or more of the following, which reflect the physical address of the resident:

A U.S. or Virginia income tax return from the previous year
A U.S. Internal Revenue Service tax reporting W-2 form from the current year or its equivalent
A deed or lease agreement to the residence, a mortgage bill for the residence 
A voter registration card, a receipt for personal property taxes paid within the last year and/or a payroll check or payroll check stub issued by an employer within the last three months. 
A utility bill will be accepted, and will be counted as one of the two proofs of residence, only if the utility bill is presented in conjunction with a lease or mortgage bill that shows the same address as the utility bill and is in the same name as the person enrolling the student (pre-marriage names will be accepted if a picture I.D. is presented).

Additionally, a driver’s license or Virginia state issued identification card will be accepted, and will be counted as one of the two proofs of residence, only if the driver’s license or Virginia state issued I.D. is presented in conjunction with a lease or mortgage bill that shows the same address as the driver’s license or Virginia state issued I.D and is in the same name as the person enrolling the student (pre-marriage names will be accepted since a picture I.D. is being presented.)
For more on special circumstances surrounding residency and admissions, please consult RPS Board Policy 8-2.2; for more information about enrollment documents, click here.
How old does my child have to be to enter Kindergarten?
Students entering Kindergarten in fall 2023 must be 5-years-old by September 30, 2023. Students entering Kindergarten in fall 2024 must be 5-years-old by September 30, 2024.
How can I choose a school other than my zone school for my child to attend?
Each year students may participate in a process entitled “Open Enrollment”. The application period for this process will begin in the fall. Parents may select up to three “out-of-zone” schools to attend (and Patrick Henry School of Science and Arts, if eligible). These students are then placed in a lottery for the following school year. A student’s acceptance is based upon the student’s random lottery position and school enrollment capacity for “out-of-zone” applicants at each grade level. For more information click here. 
My child was homeschooled for the previous school year, but is returning to RPS for the coming school year. Do they need to enroll?
Yes. Students who have spent at least one academic year away from RPS must enroll for the new school year at Enroll RPS (www.attendrvaschools.com). In addition to completing the enrollment form at Enroll RPS, students that were homeschooled will need submit evidence of achievement per the Virginia Guidelines.
Students that were taught by a certified teacher need to have a letter from the teacher stating the content that the student mastered and a recommendation on promotion to the next grade level. Please share this information with your school team when you enroll, and with questions, please contact Valenta Wade, vwade@rvaschools.net.










Enrollment Process Overview





Enrollment for school year 2023-2024 opened on Wednesday, March 1, 2023. Note that students who turned 5-years-old on or before September 30, 2023 are eligible to enroll in kindergarten. Per the Code of Virginia, parents/guardians of any child who will not have reached his sixth birthday on or before September 30 of each school year may delay the child's attendance for one year. Click kindergarten enrollment policies to read more.
Richmond City residents with a school-aged student must follow this simple process to enroll:
1. Determine your eligibility.
A child must be residing with a parent or legal guardian in Richmond City to attend Richmond Public Schools. If you aren’t sure if your residence is within the RPS boundary, use our School Locator to find out. Click to read the full text of RPS’s residency policy.
Kindergarten Age Requirement

A child may enter kindergarten if they will turn five on or before September 30 of the year they enter school (for school year 2023-2024, September 30, 2023). This age requirement also applies to students who transfer from other school districts after the start of the school year. 
Families interested in applying for their child to attend kindergarten early (that is, if their child will not turn five on or before September 30) can review the early kindergarten screening process.

 2. Prepare your enrollment documents.
Families enrolling in Richmond Public Schools must provide several documents during enrollment, including proof of residency in Richmond City (two proofs are required), the child’s original birth certificate or a certified copy (a scanned copy or photograph can be uploaded but the physical document must be presented before the student is enrolled), a child's health information including a physical, and a child's immunization records (this may vary depending on your child's grade level). Use the "Document Requirements" button under the Frequently Asked Questions tab below for more information. Required Documents may vary based on the child's grade.
Families will be required to upload documents in the online enrollment form, or provide them in person at their zone school during a scheduled appointment, before their child can be enrolled. The child's birth certificate must be provided in person.
3. Complete the online enrollment form in Enroll RPS. 
RPS kindergarten enrollment must be completed in Enroll RPS (www.attendrvaschools.com). Families enrolling a student in RPS for the first time will need to create an account when they first visit. Returning families should use the same login information used for enrollment or school applications of other children. Watch a quick video on how to create an account.
Enroll RPS separates the steps of the enrollment form into short sections, and allows families to save their progress and return to their work at a later date. Despite this helpful functionality, we encourage families to enroll as soon as possible!
4. Schedule an appointment at your school to complete the process.
Per the Code of Virginia, a family must present their child's birth certificate (or a certified copy) to enroll in a school division in Virginia for the first time. Upon completion of the enrollment form, families will receive an email/call from their school to schedule an in-person appointment for this final step.
Need additional support?
Our school staff members are excited to support you with the enrollment process, and we look forward to welcoming you and your child next school year! 
If you need additional assistance with the online form, you can make an appointment by calling your zone school (RPS School Directory). If you do make an appointment, please try to visit with all required enrollment documents to minimize the number of visits required.
