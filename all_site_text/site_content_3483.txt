		Students Keep Devices for Summer Learning




May 8 2024



We are excited to share with you a new change in our school-assigned device program. Beginning this summer, students in 1st through 11th grade will keep their school-assigned device year-round. This change was made to ensure all students have access to ebooks, audiobooks, and the ReadSquared summer reading program at home on their own device all summer! Additionally, taking their device home over the summer will allow all students to access online educational and enrichment resources to explore and create. Reading, thinking, and creating over the summer will continue to build the skills students learn in school and decrease the chance of learning loss while school is not in session.
Be sure to follow the Mesquite ISD Facebook or visit our www.mesquiteisd.org/summer-device webpage for tips and ideas to help your student learn and explore on their device all summer.
Moving to New Campus or Withdrawing?
Students moving to a new campus within the district will take their assigned school device with them on the first day of school. The device will be transferred in August to their account at the new campus. 
Students who are leaving Mesquite ISD should return their assigned device to their current campus when completing the withdrawal process.
Summer Device Help
We know accidents happen and want to make sure your child’s device is working properly all summer as well as when they return to school. Our student help desk will be available during the summer for troubleshooting help and also to request repairs. Please contact the help desk at 972-882-8788 or send an email to stuhelpdesk@mesquiteisd.org as soon as a problem occurs.
If you have any additional questions or concerns, please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions document.

		West Mesquite Art Team Wins Grant to Create Art Exhibit at SPARK! Dallas




Mar 11 2024



The art team Snake Eyes from West Mesquite High School has been selected as one of the six winners in the PRISMATIC competition. This competition invited high school students to design an immersive art pop-up experience for SPARK!, inspired by MeowWolf. The team has been awarded a grant of $2,500 to design and sculpt a pop-up art installation room for the PRISMATIC Exhibit at SPARK! Dallas. The exhibit is scheduled to open on June 1, 2024.
Snake Eyes is a group of seven WMHS students from 10th to 12th grade who collaborated under the supervision of Mesquite ISD art teacher Megan Eakins. They worked together to develop a concept, design proposal and budget. Their winning proposal centers around an interactive forest that challenges visitors to choose between generosity and greed.
Over the next two months, the Meow Wolf Grapevine directors will mentor the students as they plan, create and install their designs. This collaborative effort will provide students with valuable hands-on experience. The immersive pop-up will open to the public from June through September 2024. 
Members of the Snake Eyes Team are Chris Ruiz, Jasmine Bussell, Emma Hasbun, Haley Rojas, Heaven Medders, Mariah Mercado and Esmerelda Soto.

		MISD Achieves Heart Safe School Designation Across All 52 Campuses




Feb 15 2024



In collaboration with Cook Children’s Hospital, Mesquite ISD has become one of only 27 Heart Safe School Districts in the state of Texas, with each of the 52 MISD campuses receiving individual “Heart Safe School” designations through Project Adam. Project Adam is a national organization that aims to ensure schools are equipped with the necessary tools and resources to respond to cardiac emergencies.
The Heart Safe School designation is awarded to schools that complete an extensive checklist outlining campus specific measures to prepare for a cardiac emergency. These measures include: ensuring easy accessibility of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) on campus, training a medical emergency response team in CPR and AED use, developing and implementing a standardized medical emergency response plan, and Medical Emergency Response Team (M.E.R.T) drills. 
Due to the unpredictability of a cardiac arrest, achieving a high level of readiness is essential to improving survival rates. “We believe if we standardize and practice our medical emergency response on each campus, we will be in the best position to save the life of a child, staff member or family member,” said Macey Melton, Director of Health Services.




		Renovated Mesquite Natatorium Now Home To MISD Swim Team 




Feb 12 2024



Formerly known as the aquatic center of Dallas College Eastfield Campus, the Mesquite Natatorium has been expanded and upgraded to serve MISD students and City of Mesquite residents.
"We are proud to offer this state-of-the-art facility to our students and community members, and we are excited to see the positive impact it will have on our community," said Mesquite ISD Superintendent Dr. Ángel Rivera.


Key features of the Mesquite Natatorium at Dallas College's Eastfield Campus include:


Expanded pool width to accommodate capacity


Two diving boards for enhanced aquatic experiences


Eight 25-yard swim lanes and six 25-meter swim lanes


Pool depth ranging from 3.6 feet to 12.5 feet


New tile and updated pool finish


Installation of a competition-ready Myrtha gutter system


Transparent OpenAire aluminum structure


The most innovative aspect of the 13,580-square-foot natatorium is its transparent OpenAire aluminum structure, which allows for year-round usage regardless of weather conditions. The design enables the enclosure to open during good weather, providing an outdoor pool experience.
The Mesquite ISD swim team began practicing in the natatorium last month. The facility opens to the public on Monday, Feb. 12.

		Kevin Carbó Reelected to State Association Board




Oct 20 2023





Kevin Carbó of Mesquite ISD has been reelected to a three-year term on the Texas Association of School Boards (TASB) Board of Directors, representing TASB Region 10, Position D. The election was held during the Association’s 2023 Delegate Assembly on Sept. 30 in Dallas.

		Elementary Schools Now Staffed with Armed Security Guards




Sep 7 2023



As an added layer of daily security, all Mesquite ISD elementary campuses now have a designated armed security guard who will be on site each day. These security personnel undergo the same background checks and fingerprinting as other MISD employees. While they will serve as consistent, valued campus team members, the guards are not law enforcement officers. Guards will not:

Discipline students
Be asked to participate in student discipline
Be asked to supervise a student one on one
Counsel/meet/mentor students in a private setting
Leave the campus for any reason prior to being relieved

This latest step ensures that Mesquite ISD complies with recent legislation requiring armed security for all public school campuses. Similarly, all MISD middle and high school campuses have at least one school resource officer (SRO) on staff to provide a daily law enforcement presence.
