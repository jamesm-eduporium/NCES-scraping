Established
1997








The Central Pennsylvania Chapter of the national Football Foundation has been supporting high school and college scholar-athletes since 1997. 

Penn State University has been instrumental in the impact and growth of the chapter. The chapter is also closely aligned with the Central Pennsylvania Football Coaches Association in promoting and recognizing the scholar-athletes in 36 schools in a nine county region. 

The Scholar-Athlete Banquet is the highlight of the chapter's year. Additionally, college students-athletes from three regional collegiate institutions - Penn State University, Lock Haven University and Juniata College receive recognition. The banquet allows the chapter to publicize the academic and athletic achievements of these students while they serve as leaders and role models in the community.
