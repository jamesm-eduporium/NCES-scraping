Welcome






Hello and thank you for visiting the Lawton Community Schools website. Lawton Community Schools is a school district comprised of approximately 1,000 students K - 12 located in southwest Michigan. Our academic achievement typically ranks among the top schools in both our county and conference. Lawton Community Schools remains on solid financial ground while offering a full selection of opportunities for our students. Our facilities are well maintained, with new middle and high school buildings in 2004.
Parents appreciate the on-site preschool and child care programs available which provide a great start for our younger children. In addition, students at Lawton High School have dual enrollment opportunities at area colleges and Advanced Placement courses with highly qualified teachers in our own classrooms. A variety of co-curricular clubs are also sponsored by our schools. An alternative high school learning option is available at the Lawton Accelerated Academic Center. This online learning opportunity allows students to move at their own pace as they pursue their diploma. Lawton High School is among the leaders in the county utilizing the world class Van Buren Technology Center to enhance the educational experience of our students. Technology Center programs are available focusing on both immediate career entry and specific college program preparation.
