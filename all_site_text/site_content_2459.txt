Woodland Community College









Woodland Joint Unified School District partners with Yuba CommunityCollege District to provide free tuition for current high school students who would like to take college classes while enrolled in high school (books   
are not included in the free tuition and may require an additional cost). Students will need to work with their counselor to get approval for taking college classes while enrolled in high school.

Please click on the documents below for directions on how to enroll in a YCCD college course as a high school student and for an informational page with equivalent courses listed.  
 
 
   
 
 

Current 9th through 11th grade students will have the opportunity to attend a workshop in late spring, each school year, to receive support with the WCC application process if they are interested in taking summer classes through the college.  

 

Current 12th grader students will have the opportunity to attend workshops in March of each school year to receive support with the WCC application process if they are interested in attending WCC after graduation.
