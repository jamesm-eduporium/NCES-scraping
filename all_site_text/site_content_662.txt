Lead Founder & Executive DirectorDiana Diaz-HarrisonDiana Díaz-Harrison, M.Ed. is the Lead Founder and Executive Director at Arizona Autism Charter Schools (AZACS). She was inspired to start the school by her son, Sammy, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of two. Like many parents, she struggled to find an appropriate school for her son and decided to do something about it.
In 2012, she formed a board of parents and grandparents of children with autism along with professionals in the field of Applied Behavior Analysis. Together, they drafted a proposal for an instructional program and business plan to create Arizona’s first autism-focused charter school. Diana presented this plan to the Arizona Charter School’s Association and was selected to participate in a competitive Charter Starter Development Program. After completing this program, she submitted a successful charter application to the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools, which was approved in 2013. Once approved, Diana worked with her team to apply for prestigious start-up grants to gain the capital needed to start the school. It was an arduous labor of love, and the school opened successfully in the fall of 2014.
Diana possesses a unique combination of experience in broadcast media, public relations and education. While her early career experience was as a bilingual school teacher in California, she later held several prominent positions in broadcast media and public relations. Prior to dedicating herself full-time to AZACS, she was a Senior Communications Strategist at Salt River Project (SRP), Arizona’s leading utility company. In 1999, she came to the Phoenix market to serve as Univision 33’s lead Spanish language news anchor and reporter focusing on education and medical news.
Her professional career turned to education once again, after her son, Sammy, was diagnosed with autism. From 2007 to 2009, she served as Hispanic Community Relations Strategist for the Southwest Autism Research & Resource Center (SARRC). In this role, she brought autism awareness to the forefront of the Hispanic Community by working with Univision television and radio to produce weekly news segments on this widespread neuro-diversity. In October of 2009, Diana was recognized with an Emmy nomination for her news reports on autism. While working at SARRC, Diana conducted multiple trainings to teach educators about the characteristics of autism and strategies to connect parents to early intervention services. It was her professional experience at SARRC that connected Diana to the leading professionals in the treatment and education of children with autism and what planted the idea of starting a school.
In her role as Lead Founder and Executive Director, Diana has worked with her team to open three successful campuses and an accredited online school in just nine years of operation. Each year, the schools meet and exceed their academic goals as approved by the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools.
AZACS has been recognized by several prominent educational entities such as Charter Schools Growth Fund, A for Arizona, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey’s Office of Education, and most recently was the top million dollar winner of the Yass Prize. Diana’s goal is to help each student become a fulfilled, productive citizen. She is doing this by develop community partnerships that can lead to jobs and ensuring students are ready for college and vocational opportunities. As the mother of a child with autism, her driving force is to create a life of purpose and fulfilling opportunities for her students.

STEAM and Innovation DirectorSupreet KaurMy name is Supreet Kaur, and I am the High School Math Teacher. It is indeed a matter of great pride and honor to work with this wonderful team at AZACS. I am deeply influenced by the professional and empathetic attitude of the entire team. It is going to be an enchanting experience working as a high school teacher at AZACS. I have a strong self-belief to acquaint the students at AZACS with the best academic knowledge and skills. I shall leave no stone unturned to make them responsible, mindful and independent human beings.
I am a graduate and a post graduate in Biotechnology. Additionally I’m currently enrolled in Masters of Education in Educational Leadership at Northern Arizona University. I have twelve years of experience in teaching and facilitating different age groups, especially teenagers. This is my third exciting year at AZACS. I have worked as an academic coordinator with Cambridge International School in India. I have taught Biology and Science at the high school level under Cambridge Assessments International Education, which is affiliated with the University of Cambridge, UK. I have been consistently gearing myself up by participating and attending different academic and administrative workshops, and am excited to implement my learning within the classroom.
My hobbies are reading non-fiction. I love to travel and explore new places. I love to spend time with my family.
I look forward to having an amazing academic year!

Chief Academic OfficerMyla GoyneMy name is Myla Goyne and I am honored to serve as the Director for the Elementary Campus. I started working with a variety of students in 2001 as an intern, and then special education paraprofessional while I attended Arizona State University and graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. During that time is when I discovered my love for working with students with exceptionalities, and decided to further my education and obtain my Master of Education in Special Education. Since then, I have served as a Special Education Teacher, Special Education Instructional Coach, and Exceptional Student Services Coordinator. To prepare for my role as a district administrator, I obtained my Supervisor and Principal Certification, and I am finishing my second Masters with a focus on Educational Leadership.

This will be my second year in this role at AZACS, and I am looking forward to continuing the growth and progress both staff and students accomplished last year. I am especially excited about the opportunity to work alongside Traci, our new ABA Director, and partner with her to provide our students with a positive school experience.

During my free time, my partner Tom and I enjoy vacationing to explore new places, but we seem to be drawn to more beach themed adventures. Nothing beats a good book and sand between the toes. We also enjoy catching a concert or spending time with our families which include his teenage triplet sons and daughter and our two dogs.

Thank you for your continued support of AZACS, and please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or topics you would like to discuss. I look forward to working with you all!

School Wellness Registered NurseJessica Mangieri, RN, BSNMy name is Jessica Mangieri and I am the School Wellness Registered Nurse. I attended Arizona State University to obtain my Bachelors of Science in Nursing (BSN) while concurrently completing all of my nursing coursework through Mesa Community College. Nursing has proven to be a field where I feel I can incorporate my love of science, education, and a desire to help others.

I have a previous degree from Arizona State University in Elementary Education. I never ended up teaching in a traditional public school classroom after graduation, but instead worked with children and families at the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center (SARRC) for 4 years. My role was to provide training in Applied Behavior Analysis and support families new to an Autism diagnosis. I absolutely loved being able to see families become empowered with the knowledge that revealed great hope for their futures.

Additionally, I worked as a lead teacher at a school for children with a variety of developmental disorders. I loved working alongside staff to incorporate evidence-based practices within the classroom setting. This experience brings a great foundation to collaborating with both staff and families here at AZACS.

Outside of AZACS, I’m a mom of two awesome kids, ages 7 and 8. My husband and I enjoy any traveling we can do (especially the beach!), hiking, camping and cooking. We love our Shepherd-mix doggie named Dolly! I’m looking forward to building meaningful relationships with the families at AZACS.

School Nutrition ManagerHolly Vaughan 








 


UC Campus DirectorDenise BallardMy name is Denise Ballard, and I am so happy to have joined this amazing team as the Assistant Director for the middle and high school. This is my 25th year working in education and with students with special needs.

In 1996, I graduated from Buffalo State College in Buffalo, NY. Following my graduation, I moved to Arizona to be a special education teacher. I decided to stay here and teach in different capacities. I have been a resource room teacher, I have been a self-contained teacher and I have been a coach.

Knowing that I enjoyed working with adults and supporting them in the classroom, I attended ASU to obtain my Masters Degree in Educational Leadership. I then was able to work as an administrator at a school for students with special needs. Supporting teachers in their journey has been very rewarding as I watch new teachers grow into teachers who continually learn, care for, and assist as students develop, grow and learn.

While I am not at work, you can find me with my two teenage children and our two dogs, Huckleberry and Sonny! I enjoy early mornings to myself, either running or getting in some gym time.

ELC Campus DirectorPatrick Masson
My name is Patrick Masson, and I am the Assistant Director at the Early Learning Center. I graduated from the University of Connecticut with a Bachelors in Sociology. I started working with students with Autism in 2009 when I worked as an ABA Therapist in the Connecticut public school system.

I have been a part of the AZACS family since we opened our doors in 2014. At AZACS, I have worked as a Co-Teacher, a Special Education Teacher, and a Special Education Program Manager. Since coming on board, I went back to school and received my Masters in Special Education from Grand Canyon University. I am also currently enrolled in a program to pursue an additional Masters in Education, with a focus on Educational Leadership, through Northern Arizona University.
Outside of Special Education, I am an adventurer in every shape of the word. I love to travel, hike, & run. I have participated in 16 Ragnar Relays to date (9 of them being out of state), with hopefully many more to come!
