Citizen's Oversight Committee (COC) Advertisement Notice and Application

NOTICE is hereby given that the Live Oak School District has established a citizens’ oversight committee to oversee expenditures of Measure H bond funds, which was the bond measure approved by District voters on March 5, 2024. The District is accepting applications from interested citizens to serve on the committee. The committee will consist of seven members who meet, review and report on expenditures of bond funds to ensure money is used only for voter-approved purposes. Interested persons may obtain an application from the Superintendent’s office, located at 984-1 Bostwick Lane, Santa Cruz, CA 95062, or download the application from the District’s website at www.losd.ca. Applications are due by 4 pm on May 29, 2024.
The applicants will be selected as participating members of the Committee by an appointment made by the District Board through the following process:
a) appropriate local groups with members which may meet the above criteria will be solicited for applications;
b) the Superintendent or such officer’s designee will review the applications;
c) the Superintendent or his designee will make recommendations to the Board;
d) the District Board will confirm its selection and appointment by resolution.
The Board of Trustees will make their appointments on the June 12, 2024 board meeting.
