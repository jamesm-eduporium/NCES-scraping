Principal's Message



Welcome to Yorba Linda High School, home of the Mustangs! Established in 2009, YLHS will celebrate our 15-year anniversary this school year. YLHS is a school founded on the traditions of academic excellence, student connections, and strong community involvement. YLHS is a California Distinguished School, Gold Ribbon School, and U.S. News and World Report Top High School. We have a 90% Advanced Placement pass rate and, based on state test scores, rank in the top 10% of public high schools academically in Orange County. 
 
Yorba Linda High School’s mission is to support all students to “Run with the STAMPEDE: Service, Teamwork, Achievement, Mastery, Passion, Ethics, Dedication, and Excellence.” Our STAMPEDE values impact our community, as we strive to graduate students who are prepared to show respect, responsibility, and integrity in all that they do. Together, we are a part of something much larger - we are all Mustangs! 
 
The teachers and staff members of Yorba Linda High School commit themselves not only to academic excellence but to promoting each student’s success beyond the classroom. Students have many opportunities to get involved on campus, and our teachers and staff members are always here to support. We encourage all our students to participate in our award-winning athletic teams, arts programs, and clubs. Here at YLHS, there is something for everyone!
 
We look forward to a great 2023-2024 school year as we continue our traditions of academic excellence and student connectedness while partnering with our parents and our community members to meet the academic, social, and emotional needs of all of our students. Again, we are so happy you are a part of our Mustang family!
 
Go Mustangs!
 
Richard Dinh
Principal
