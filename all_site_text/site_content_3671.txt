Home  Families  PTA  Room Parents  Staff Appreciation Week



Staff Appreciation Week








Staff Appreciation Week (SAW) happens in May each year. The PTA develops a schedule of special events to recognize Coyote Creek's Staff during this week. Room Parents are asked to help with a couple of the week's events (see schedule below). Room Parents should feel free request help from parents in class as needed. Room Parents are encouraged NOT to collect money from the class for a gift for their Teacher during Staff Appreciation Week, though. Group gift-giving is typically reserved for the holidays, end of school year, and/or a birthday. Additionally, a list of all the things the PTA has done to support the School Staff throughout the year will be posted. Some of these things include the following:
 


First Day of School Lunch
Holiday Lunch
Coffee
School Spirit
Yard Duty Help
Room Parent Support
School Paper
