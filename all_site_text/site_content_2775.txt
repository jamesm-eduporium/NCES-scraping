At Indian Creek Middle School, we believe in engaging every student, every day in quality learning opportunities. Our dedicated staff strives to create opportunities for students to be creative, challenged, and collaborative. We are incredibly proud of the opportunities we offer outside of the classroom for students to grow as well. Students have a wide range of extra curricular activities that include Robotics Club, FFA, State Champion Academic Teams and the middle school musical to name just a few. As Principal, I have spent the last nine years in the NHJ School District. This year promises to be one to remember with our construction projects nearing completion and new facilities opening for our students. We are all looking forward to putting our expanded campus to use and seeing our students shine on the stage and on the court. Please be sure to follow our school Facebook page and website for updated newsletters and communication.
