Staff 






























The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was signed into law in December 2015. Section 1112 (e)(i)(ii), addresses the parent’s right to know. You have the right to request information about the qualifications of your child’s teacher, which includes state license status with approved subject areas, emergency/provisional status, and field of discipline. You also have the right to request information about paraprofessionals if any are providing services to your child, and what their qualifications are.
