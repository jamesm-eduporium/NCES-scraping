Self Care


You Are Here:  Home  Staff  Self Care







Self care has become a hot topic recently, and at times can start to sound cliche. During this pandemic, self care has become even more challenging for those of us whose self care activities have been limited (going to a gym, visiting family and friends, treating yourself to a nice meal out, etc). The recent fires and thick smoke in the air adds an even more tricky layer to this challenge.
Exercise? Nope. Go hiking? Nope. Sit outside and enjoy a cold beverage? Ain't going to happen right now.
If you find that your usual self care strategies are now limited due to our current environmental restrictions, please sit down with one of the self care lists and find things that are feasible in order to care for your brain and body.
Stay Hopeful - and focus on how great it will be to have some relief.
