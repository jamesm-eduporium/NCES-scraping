Bio


It is a great pleasure to be serving as your principal of Hygiene Elementary. I have been in education for 25 years and have taught K-8 as a general education teacher, special education teacher, and a literacy coach at the building level for 15 years. In addition, I have worked at the district level as a coordinator for Secondary Literacy, Social Studies and 504 and Response to Intervention for three years. It is my firm belief that all children can learn if we plant the seed. As a community, we need to work in a partnership and provide the resources necessary so all students can excel and reach their potential in a global economy.
I also wear another distinguished hat, and that is motherhood. I have a daughter and son that have attended Hygiene. My husband and I wanted our two children to experience a rich education that includes passionate, and dedicated teachers, amazing support staff, a supportive and strong PTO, and a caring community with excellent values. It is these characteristics that make Hygiene an outstanding school. I invite you to contact me and tour our rigorous and robust academic program which provides countless opportunities for your child to learn and grow. Please do not hesitate to contact me.
