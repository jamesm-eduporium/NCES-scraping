School Emergency Wireless Phone Numbers:
Used only when phone service is down
When a school’s normal phone service is interrupted, the emergency phone lines below will be monitored for incoming urgent calls. DVISD may use its telephone, email, website or social media accounts to communicate important information during interrupted phone service. As such, we ask that you do not call the emergency phone lines listed below unless necessary; this allows the phone lines to remain accessible for handling urgent calls. Please note these lines will only be available and answered during phone service interruptions.
