		Code Blue protocols enacted at Christopher High School following altercation between students. Staff and students are safe.

May 22 2024



On May 22, 2024 Christopher High School was placed on code blue lockdown, as Gilroy Police Department and the Gilroy Fire Department responded to an incident involving two students which resulted in one student being stabbed by the other.  

Christopher High School staff and the School Resource Officers quickly intervened, and code blue protocols were enacted campus-wide at approximately 11:58 am.

The victim was transported to a local hospital, and the suspect was arrested. The code blue was lifted at 12:58 pm as first responders completed their investigation.  

Counselors are onsite at Christopher High to provide support to students requesting it.  District leadership are also onsite to provide support through the end of the school day.
