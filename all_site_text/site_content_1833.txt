Bio



I am so excited to join the Grand View community! This is my 23rd year in education and I come to you with a wealth of experience in teaching grades K-12 in both Special Education and General Education. For the past 23 years, I have taught and led in Adams 12 Five Star School district and I am excited for my new adventure in St. Vrain. As the principal of Grand View, I am committed to exemplifying excellence and building a strong community to benefit our students, staff and families.
I have three children of my own that keep my husband and I very busy! Isabella is starting school to be a nurse, Vincenzo is in 8th grade and Niccolina is in 7th grade. My husband Joshua is an Assistant Principal at an elementary school in Jeffco Public Schools. When I am not at work I enjoy spending time with my family, camping, scrapbooking, and photographing special occasions. I look forward to meeting our families and working together to build our Grand View community. Please stop by anytime to speak with me about any celebrations or concerns that you may have regarding your student. I look forward to our partnership!
