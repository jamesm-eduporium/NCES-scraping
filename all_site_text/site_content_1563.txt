		East Elementary Field and Fun Day Culminates with Staff Inflatable Costume Race!



Jun 17 2024



East Elementary students were treated to a Field and Fun Day on June 17 before cheering on their teachers and school administrators in an exciting race featuring inflatable costumes!
The students took to the side field at the school to take part in fun outdoor activities such as an obstacle course, soccer and basketball as well as hula hooping. Other students participated in a cup-stacking challenge and others donned pool floats and ran a relay race with pool noodles.
The culmination of the day was the Staff Inflatable Costume Race, where teachers and the school administration all donned inflatable costumes and ran from one side of the field to the other and back. The inflatable costumes included animals both prehistoric and current, with dinosaurs and flamingos racing koala bears, chickens and dogs as well as an upside-down clown and a unicorn. Congratulations to Ms. Aviles Velasco who won both races with the blue dinosaur!
