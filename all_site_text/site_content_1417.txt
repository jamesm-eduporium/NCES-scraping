Bio


I joined the CRMS team in 2010 and have been an educator in the St. Vrain Valley School District since 1991. I obtained my BA from Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota, majoring in Psychology and Secondary Education. I then attended CU Boulder and obtained a Master's Degree in Education with an additional endorsement in K-12 Literacy.
I began working in administration in 2004. Additionally, I am the mother of three including two SVVSD graduates and a SVVSD high school senior.
