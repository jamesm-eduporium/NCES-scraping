OUR PROMISE

Belong. Believe. Achieve. 



"At Beaverton School District, all students belong. We embrace, honor and celebrate our differences — race, color, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and language. We're committed to eliminating the structures, policies and practices that perpetuate inequalities in our schools and causes these differences to become predictors of future success. At BSD, all students are learners, capable of limitless possibilities.”
Dr. Gustavo Balderas, Superintendent
