Mission & Vision
The vision of the Port Chester School District is SUCCESS FOR EVERY STUDENT. This vision has been internalized by every teacher, administrator and staff member who work tirelessly every day to ensure student success. The educational programs and services offered to our students reflect a quest for scholastic excellence, combined with respect and concern for the worth and development of individual students.
We are the proud recipients of two National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Awards. Port Chester Middle School was honored in 2005 and John f. Kennedy Elementary School was honored in 2010. Port Chester High School is one of the few International Baccalaureate accredited high schools in Westchester County.
The mission of the Port Chester School District, through an active partnership among community, parents, staff and students, is to develop responsible and self-sufficient citizens who value cultural diversity, are creative and adaptable, and possess the self-esteem, motivation and skills to continue individual growth, think critically, and communicate effectively.
