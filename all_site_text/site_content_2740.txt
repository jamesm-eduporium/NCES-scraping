Spanish Technology Videos




Students in the ACTO organization have recognized a need for technology resources for students and caregivers new to our country.  To respond to this need, members of the ACTO organization are creating tutorial videos that cover a wide variety of technology topics from general technology use such as Gmail and the Internet to district specific topics such as Powerschool navigation and receiving information from the district.  This is an ongoing project, so be sure to continue to visit this page as new videos are created.    
Videos are organized by topic.  Do you have an idea for another topic that you would like a video to be created for?  Please reach out to Rachel Gattuso at rgattuso@avongrove.org.
