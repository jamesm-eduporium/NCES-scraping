Special Education













The WJUSD provides a continuum of services,through students’ individual education plans, for students who qualify for special education. Students are educated in their least restrictive environment and expected to be involved in courses that address standards at their level of ability; in a general education class or in a special day class. The focus of the special day class program is on developing academic and/or functional life skills that will contribute to the student transitioning to post-secondary opportunities in school, training, work, and independent living as determined by the goals in the student’s individual education plan. Only students accessing the special day class program may be enrolled in a combination of the modified courses.
