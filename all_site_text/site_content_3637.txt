Academic Planning













An academic plan is a pathway to success. When students understand and successfully implement their plan — what courses they need, in what order, to prepare them for a specific college or career goal — they are more likely to graduate high school college and career ready.  WJUSD has set graduation requirements based around the "A - G" course requirements for the UC/CSU systems, in order to give high school students the greatest number of post-high school opportunities.
