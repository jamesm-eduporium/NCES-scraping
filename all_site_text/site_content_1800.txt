By being enrolled in the performing arts program, students will have the opportunity to realize, discover, expand, and enjoy their own unique talents; while at the same time learning to appreciate those of their fellow students. Non-performance courses are structured for students with little to extensive performing arts backgrounds. They are designed to engage students in facets of performance that most interest them; provide them with the tools to understand and create art of their own design; and ultimately prepare them for a career and/or further study in the field(s) of dance, drama, or music. Performance ensembles in our programs focus on creating 21st century musicians. Students routinely perform at school concerts and events, as well as throughout the Greater New Britain Community, and serve as cultural ambassadors for our City and State both locally and abroad.  Upcoming Events in the NBHS Performing Arts DepartmentCheck out some of our upcoming performances'Golden Hurricane' Marching Band Halftime show for the CT AmbushJune 8th @ 6PMDrumlinePercussion Clinic and AuditionsPercussion Clinic/Auditions (24-25)Message to Incoming 9th grade students  NBHS Marching Band CampAugust 12th-August 22ndNBHS BAND CAMP REHEARSALS (2024-2025)Performing Arts Calendar of EventsPlease be sure to regularly check our performing arts calendar for updates on rehearsals, meetings, events, and performances. If you would like to add our calendar to your iCal on your iPhone or other Apple devices, you may do so by using the following url link:https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_classroom781d21f4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.icsNBHS Hurricane Spirit FundThis fund was created to celebrate and recognize Hurricane school spirit and pay it forward to current and future generations of students participating in the New Britain High School Music Program.
