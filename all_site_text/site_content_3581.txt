Principal








Patricia Kawahara

My name is Patricia Kawahara and I am delighted to be joining the Sycamore Valley Elementary School community. I have been in education for over 20  years and consider it a great honor to be a part of a child’s educational journey.  Prior to joining the Sycamore Valley team, I served as principal at Sequoia Elementary School in  Mt. Diablo Unified School District.  Before joining the Sequoia family I served as an administrator in Oakland and Richmond, and an instructional coach in Walnut Creek.  Prior to jumping into administrative and coaching work I taught grades TK, 3rd, 4th, and 6th. Focusing on the whole child and supporting children across the developmental span of elementary school is a true passion and has guided my work across my career.

I grew up, primarily, in Santa Cruz and graduated from UC Santa Cruz and earned my teaching credential at Dominican University in Marin.  After teaching for a few years I pursued masters degrees from San Francisco State and UC Berkeley, earning an administrative credential at Berkeley as well.  I loved engaging in educational theory and courses while teaching, as the practical context added meaning to my learning.  I am a lifelong learner and continue to seek out opportunities for growth whether through coursework, professional development sessions, collaboration with colleagues or conversations with students and families.  

I live in Walnut Creek with my husband, two teenage children and our dog, Caramel.  I love hiking in the open space we are all so fortunate to be surrounded by, reading and catching up with friends old and new.
