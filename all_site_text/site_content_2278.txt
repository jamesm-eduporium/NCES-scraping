On this day in 1790, the United States enacts its first copyright statute, the Copyright Act of 1790.  This was the first federal copyright act to be instituted in the United States, though most of the states had passed various legislation securing copyrights in the years immediately following the Revolutionary War.  The length of copyright established by the Founding Fathers was 14 years, plus the ability to renew it one time, for 14 more years.  The initial terms was changed to 28 years 40 years later.  The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 increased it to 95 years after publication (120 years after creation for unpublished works), or the life of the author plus 70 years, whichever ends earlier.  The goal of copyright law is to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.
