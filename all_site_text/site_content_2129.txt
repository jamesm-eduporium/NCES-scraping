Bio


B.A. Cornell College, M.A. Ed. Cumberland University, M.S. Colorado State University
I am honored to serve as your child's principal for the 2022-2023 school year. This will be my 30th year in education and I can't think of a better place to be.
I earned my Bachelor's Degree from Cornell College, my Master's Degree from Cumberland University and did my principal coursework at Colorado State University. I am a former teacher, Instructional Coach and District Wide Literacy Specialist. When I'm not at school, I enjoy hiking, riding my road bike, swimming, boating and spending time with friends. I live in a small town near Mead with my family. My wonderful husband is also a principal, my daughter is the light of my life, and my stepson brings fun and energy to our lives.
Mead Elementary offers a long and proud tradition of educating students and being a valuable part of the Mead community. In order to prepare today's students to meet the challenges of tomorrow, the staff and I engage in continuous learning opportunities to strengthen our programs, raise achievement, and celebrate the uniqueness of each child.  Two school wide systems that we pride ourselves on are PBIS, a positive behavior focus, and Movement, a brain researched initiative where students and staff get up and engage in movement activities twice a day at Mead Elementary in order to increase stamina during rigorous learning. Your active participation in the education of your children is very much appreciated and needed. We look forward to partnering with you to ensure success for all students while instilling the value of becoming life long learners. Together we will make a positive difference in the lives of the children of Mead Elementary.
Welcome to what promises to be an exciting and productive school year at Mead Elementary!
Respectfully,
Mrs. Betsy Ball,
M.A. Ed. Principal, Mead Elementary
