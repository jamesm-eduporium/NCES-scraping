Bio


One of the things I am most proud of is our "complete community". Legacy Elementary opened with a focus on being a community resource that would serve children. We have realized that goal by having myriad offerings for children through our parent volunteers and community connections. 
The Legacy teachers complete the picture by creating that learning environment and focus. Our children, parents, and teachers are top notch and come together to make this a fabulous place to learn, work, and grow.
