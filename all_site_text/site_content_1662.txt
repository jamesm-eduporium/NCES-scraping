Bio


I’m ToniJo Niccoli, the Principal of the Career Elevation and Technology Center and New Meridian High School, located on the Global Acceleration Campus. This is my 20th year in education and my third year as Principal of CETC and NMHS. Previously, I served four years as the Assistant Principal of our campus, and prior to my time in St. Vrain, I was a teacher,  Assistant Principal, and Athletic Director in the Greeley/Evans School District. What I love about our campus is the opportunities we provide our students. Our staff is relentlessly committed to ensuring that our students graduate from high school and participate in robust career pathway opportunities that lead to numerous certifications, college credits, and high-quality internships and apprenticeships. Our staff and students are simply the best, and serving the St. Vrain Valley Schools community is an honor. In my free time, I enjoy watching my daughter play volleyball, traveling, spending time with family and friends, and playing terrible golf.
