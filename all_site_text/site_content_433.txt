District
Education has always been an important focus for the Town of East Lyme. Our first quintessential one room schoolhouse was established in the early 1730's. It was titled "Little Boston" by the surrounding neighborhoods as the quality of education was comparable to the largest city to the north, Boston. In the early 1930's a new, large brick structure was erected and proudly service today as East Lyme's Central Education Office.
