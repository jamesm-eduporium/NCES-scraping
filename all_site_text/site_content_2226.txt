Bio


I am thrilled to have the opportunity to serve the students, families and staff of Longmont Estates Elementary as the Principal. I love what I do!
Prior to joining the Longmont Estates Elementary team, I was the Assistant Principal at Black Rock Elementary in Erie.  I also worked as the Lead Professional Development Coach for the St. Vrain Valley School district. In this role, I helped to support new teachers, developed online training courses, and lead professional development throughout our district. During this time, I also taught graduate and undergraduate education courses at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
I am a graduate of Longmont High School and received my undergraduate degree from the University of Northern Colorado. I completed my Master's Program in Literacy at the University of Colorado at Boulder and earned my administrator's license from Western Governor's University. I have been a teacher in the primary grades, and a Title 1 reading teacher for grades K-5.
While I am not at school, I enjoy spending time with my husband and two daughters.
It is an honor and a privilege to be a part of the Longmont Estates Community! I am dedicated to ensuring that your child has an outstanding school experience. Please feel free to contact me at any time.
