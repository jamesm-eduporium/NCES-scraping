The primary focus of the school counseling program is to promote and enhance student learning for all students through academic, personal, social and college or career development counseling.
Academic Development Counseling
Counselors will work in a collaborative approach to support the student learning process and promote academic achievement with consideration of student ability and learning style. Counselors will regularly monitor their students' courses and accumulation of credits to ensure that they are meeting the graduation requirements of Morristown High School and The NJ State Department of Education.
