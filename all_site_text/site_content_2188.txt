Bishop WandaWanda Bishop Social Worker Send message »   EducationBS in Human Development & Family Studies - University of Alabama (2006)Master of Social Work - University of Alabama (2009)
ExperienceI hail from the great state of Alabama. (Roll Tide!) I moved to Phoenix in 2017 as an empty nester ready to explore the next chapter of my life.
Upon my initial arrival to AZ, I served as a long-term substitute and later a full-time teacher for kindergarten and second, fourth, and fifth grade. The 2022–2023 school year marked my second year serving as a school social worker.
I spent most of my professional career (12 years) working in student affairs at the University of Alabama, where I served in various capacities—the most relevant position was a student care specialist providing crisis intervention for students and their families.
Why I TeachI believe that every child has the capacity to blossom into wonderful individuals in spite of past traumas if equipped with the right tools early on. My goal is to disrupt the discourse one student at a time with hopes of building a brighter and better tomorrow for us all.

ExperienceThe 2022–2023 school year marked my third year teaching, though my ninth year overall in Santa Maria.
Why I TeachI knew I wanted to work with kids but never knew what route my life would take. I have been working at Santa Maria for many years before I saw myself in a teaching position. I love to read and want to nurture and encourage that with my students. I also want to create a space of safety and creativity for the kids and a place where I can encourage them to be themselves.

Why I TeachI teach because I care about the students in our community. I want to inspire and give our students hope in my classroom. I want our students to learn that education is the key to improving the possibilities for the future. As the world becomes smaller through technology, I feel that it's important for the younger generation to become familiar with the world around them. I would like students to realize that the world, albeit different in many parts, is full of wonder and generosity that should be discovered with an open mind and heart.

Why I TeachI teach so that students will not need me. My ultimate goal is to create self motivated and lifelong learners. I want my students to use all the resources and tools available to them and have the awareness to know what they do not know and learn it. Gone should be the days when the student thinks that the teacher is the only way to learn but one of many.

Why I TeachChildren today are living in a world of new and ever changing possibilities. I teach so I can help kids develop into adults who not only function and contribute but who thrive and lead the next generation. The influences children have are not always conducive and supportive of education. Making sure school is a fun, safe, and positive experience frees up young minds to wonder and discover the mysteries of life, which helps them grow and learn. I teach because I enjoy being with young people and helping them find the wonder in our world.

I want to teach our students to be mindful and aware of how their actions influence and impact others.

Experience10 years in seventh grade at SMMS
Why I TeachI choose to teach because as a child I struggled in elementary school, and I had a few teachers who worked with me by going above and beyond their job title to assist me. I feel like I owe it to the future to teach my students in a way those teachers taught me because their patience allowed me to become a successful student.

ExperienceTwo years - Rancho Solano Prep (third grade), Two years - Camelback Academy (third–fifth grade), Eight years - SMMS (seventh grade)
Why I TeachMy love for teaching began at a very young age due to being the oldest of six children. I started out teaching my younger siblings about sports and life. By the age of sixteen, I was coaching them in organized sports, mostly soccer, baseball, and wrestling. When my siblings grew up, I stopped coaching and was working in the restaurant business. One night, a gentleman approached me and told me I had coached his son in baseball and he had been looking for me to tell me how grateful he was for the positive impact I had on his son. As I watched him walk away, I realized what I needed to do, and the next day I enrolled in the Master of Education program at Grand Canyon University.

Prior to that, I spent many years volunteering for local elementary schools that my nieces and nephew attended.
Why I TeachI teach because I believe all children deserve a quality education. I had a couple of incredible teachers during my education whose patience and understanding have had an effect on my life to this day. I hope to be that for my students as well.

ExperienceI have been teaching for 12 years. 2022–2023 is my second year of teaching at SMMS.
Why I TeachI teach because it brings joy to know that others learn from me. It gives a sense of fulfillment when they apply in real life the knowledge they acquired in school. With that, it reminds me of the crucial role that teachers play in society as persons responsible for molding the minds of learners to create a better world as they grow. For me, nothing beats the noble feeling of having changed someone positively and helped them reach their potential one day at a time.

ExperienceI started my teaching career as an aide on the playground. I then moved into many different roles around the school I worked at, from running the computer lab to working in the classroom. After graduating college, I started as a sixth grade teacher for one year. I then came to Santa Maria Middle School where I taught seventh grade math for seven years. I've most recently been teaching eighth grade math for and Digital Media. I love doing new things and taking on new challenges every year.
Why I TeachTeaching always presents me with something new to learn or master. I'm always finding ways to improve as a teacher and new challenges to take on. Every year is a different experience with its own rewards and its own challenges.

ExperienceI have over two decades of experience molding young minds at Santa Maria. I also taught Marines, life skills, and military skills for over a decade while in the Marine Corps.
Why I TeachI teach because, as far as I am concerned, the most valuable asset in the world is the mind of a child. I love being able to help my students learn right from wrong. Also, teaching them to evaluate the past as well as current facts to make sound decisions (true critical thinking) is the greatest feeling in the world.

He believes that all his students are valuable for the continued success of our society. A firm believer in peer-to-peer mediation, he manages his classroom by holding students accountable for their actions and expects that their conflicts with each other can be resolved if they learn how to communicate, apologize, and work together for future successes. Mr. Willow has managed small businesses before entering the education field, and he feels that his real-world experiences and his interactions with people from all walks of life has prepared him for working with the young adults in his classroom.

Why I TeachSince I was a child, I loved going outside and playing sports with family and friends. That passion grew in high school and college by taking all the PE/weightlifting classes I could take and participating in competitive sports for the following reasons: for enjoyment, to get in shape, and to find respite from the difficulties of life, school, and work.

ExperienceThis is my fifth year teaching.
Why I TeachTeaching came to me later in life, after time in the private sector. It became obvious that I would be happier working with students and preparing them for the future rather than helping the already rich accumulate more wealth. I am currently teaching 8th grade English language arts where I get to watch as students grow in their writing and be exposed to new ideas through reading. I also teach digital media which teaches cross-curricular skills for modern life and engages students in something they are interested in.
