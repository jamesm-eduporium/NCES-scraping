Who Do I Call?





WHO DO I CALL WITH A QUESTION OR SUGGESTION?






 




The Oceanside School District's communication protocol helps to promote direct, open and respectful interactions so that problems and concerns can be worked out quickly and efficiently. The communication protocol starts with the staff member closest to the situation, as that person will usually have the most information. 

			At times, additional personnel are required to resolve specific situations.  Appropriate communication channels for a variety of topics are listed below.  The district encourages any and all questions from parents and residents regarding school matters.
