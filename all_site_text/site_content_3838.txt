Hats Off to Our Amazing Custodial Staff 



 


 

October 4, 2023 












Our dedicated custodians are the unsung heroes of our school, tirelessly working behind the scenes to ensure a clean and safe learning environment for our students, teachers, and staff.



Mr. O



Ms. Mary





Mr. Brown



Mr. Davis


These “Wolves of Cleanliness” have a knack for making our school sparkle and shine. From sweeping away the dust to ensuring our hallways gleam, they are always on the prowl for dirt and grime. Our mascot may be a wolf, but these custodians are experts at keeping things spotless!
Join us in celebrating our day custodians, Mr. O, Ms. Mary, and Mr. Brown, and our evening custodian, Mr. Davis, for their outstanding work. They make Virtus Academy a cleaner, safer, and more welcoming place to learn and grow.
