Bio


Welcome to Alpine Elementary! I am so happy to serve the school community as your Principal. Alpine has been my home since 2004 and I am proud to have been a part of this great community for so long. I am committed to nurturing a safe, happy, and academically focused school culture, and love teaming with our amazing staff to see that happen.
 
Prior to  becoming the principal in 2017, I served as a first grade teacher, a literacy interventionist, IB Coordinator and Dean of Students. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Elementary Education from Black Hills State University, a Master of Arts degree in Curriculum and Instruction from CU Boulder, a Principal Certification from CSU, and have nearly completed a Doctorate Degree in Educational Leadership from CU Denver. I serve as an official site visitor and online instructor for the International Baccalaureate Organization and have learned a great deal from visiting IB schools throughout the United States and chatting online with IB teachers from around the globe. I love all things associated with teaching and learning, especially the students with their amazing capacity for curiosity and wonder.
 
My husband, Patrick, and I have three daughters Aubrey, Lila and Ellery who have all attended Alpine. As a family, we enjoy attending sporting events, traveling, and playing outdoors.
 
My door is always open and you will generally see me at school and PTO events, connecting with parents, students and staff in the Alpine community. Please call or email me you have questions about the school or need to talk to an administrator.
