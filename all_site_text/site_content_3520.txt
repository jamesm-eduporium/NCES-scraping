Why I TeachI come from a family of public servants including teachers, social workers, environmentalists, nurses, and military. This foundation inspired me to become a teacher. As a teacher, I have the opportunity to teach children and adults and guide them to develop their imagination and responsibility and inspire them to become lifelong learners and future leaders. I encourage my students to work to reach and fulfill their full potential in everything they do. By making learning fun, I prepare, influence, and motivate my students. My greatest joy is to witness my student's successes.

Reeser JessicaJessica Reeser 2nd Grade ELD Send message »   EducationAfter graduating High School in 2001, I attended St. Cloud State University in Minnesota and obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education. I also obtained a Masters's in Elementary Education with a Leadership emphasis from Grand Canyon University in Arizona. In addition, I am SEI and Gifted Endorsed.  
Experience15 years experience.
Why I TeachI always knew I wanted to be a teacher. I had so many great teachers that made a great impact in my life, and I wanted to be able to make great impacts for others too! I think that each year brings new challenges, and getting to meet and have so many special new students in my life each year makes me smile. The two greatest impacts in teaching for me so far are the amazing feelings you get when a student starts to recognize their own growth or a former student comes back and tells their story of how I helped make a difference for them.

Amaro AlexisAlexis Amaro  Send message »   EducationI have my Bachelor's in Education from Grand Canyon University.
ExperienceThis is my fourth year teaching and my first year in the district.
Why I TeachThe reason why I teach is to provide a safe environment where a student can learn, make mistakes, ask questions, and discover the passion to learn. Every student is different, and I hope to inspire each and every one of them. There is nothing better than seeing students find their ah-ha moment in which they find their own gift, their growth in their academics and behavior. When they are able to help someone else and feel the pride of what they can do.

Why I TeachI teach to help those students who are struggling. My own kids have had some sort of special education ranging from speech to self-contained. I enjoy seeing the look in the eyes of a student who is able to finally understand a mathematical concept or able to read more words than when they started.

Why I TeachI teach for many reasons, my current reason is the need for caring and patient adults in our students' lives. Students currently need supportive adults after recovering from unique school years that no one has experienced before. I teach my specialized program as it's an honor to be near such amazing students who have unique and powerful viewpoints of our everyday lives.

ExperienceThis is my fifth year at Western Valley Elementary and my fifth year teaching.
Why I TeachTeaching is a calling. As a lifelong learner, I love learning in general. I love sharing my love of learning with students and hope that they will love learning as well. The best moments of teaching are seeing a child understand a concept for the first time. Seeing that "light bulb" go off is incredibly rewarding.

ExperienceI am currently in my 29th year in public education. I spent 12 years as a classroom teacher in preschool through second grade. This is my 17th year as a full-release mentor teacher. In this position, I travel to the elementary schools in our district and work with first and second-year teachers.
Why I TeachI always knew I wanted to be a teacher. Some of my earliest memories are of me teaching school to my stuffed animals! I have a passion for helping children learn skills to become lifelong learners, and I know every single child has the capacity for success, given the right tools. This isn't a job for me. It is a career that I am blessed to have woven throughout all aspects of my life. My identity is being a teacher, and to watch students blossom and grow throughout each year is a wonderful gift to be a part of! In my current position, I am fortunate to collaborate with, and help grow the newest members of our profession. Every child deserves a great teacher! No exceptions!
