Nardi StephanieStephanie Nardi Principal Send message »   Education

Bachelor's degree in elementary education from the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay
Master’s degree in educational technology from Marian University, Wisconsin
Master’s degree in at-risk and alternative education from Marian University, Wisconsin
Doctorate in educational leadership from the University of Phoenix
Currently pursuing a master’s degree in adult education and training

Experience
With twenty-four years of dedication to education, my journey has been both diverse and fulfilling. For sixteen years, I taught in Wisconsin, engaging with students across every grade level from one to eight. I then transitioned to a leadership role, serving as a principal in Wisconsin for five years. My career path led me to Arizona, where I became the head of school at a preschool through grade eight school in Ahwatukee. Now, I am thrilled to be a part of the Fowler Elementary School District and lead Western Valley Middle School as I celebrate a quarter of a century in education.
Why I Teach
The most rewarding aspect of being an educator is the opportunity to build relationships and foster a supportive community of teachers and learners. Every individual in the learning community, whether child or adult, should feel valued and cared for. My mission as an educator is to create connections that cultivate a safe and successful learning environment. I am committed to ensuring that both learners and teachers feel empowered to take risks and grow in their educational journeys.

ExperienceThis is my 11th year in education and my fifth year teaching. My first year of teaching was in fifth grade. My other four years have been in sixth-grade science.
Why I TeachTeaching is such a rewarding experience. I truly enjoy getting to know the children and helping them thrive. Teaching allows me to positively influence a child's way of thinking and make a difference in their lives. I enjoy hearing all their ideas and watching their minds work. I take pride in knowing I am helping to change the future. As a teacher, I hope to inspire my students to dream big, work hard, and never give up.

Nasser MeganMegan Nasser Math Send message »   EducationB.S. in Sociology with a Minor in Math - Northern Arizona University
ExperienceFour years in education. I have spent the last four years teaching sixth-grade math at Western Valley Middle School.
Why I TeachI teach because I love teaching children how school can be applied to real life. I love helping children realize their full potential. I believe education is one of the most important things, and knowledge is something that no one can ever take away from you. Some students just need an adult in their lives to listen to them and help them advocate to get their needs met.

Little AnnetteAnnette Little Science Send message »   EducationBA Education, Highly Qualified in math and science
ExperienceI have been in education for more than 25 years. I started full-time teaching in 1981. I have taught 6th to 8th in Isaac School District, 3rd to 12th at Southwest Christian School, 1st to 6th in Peoria School District, subbed for Phoenix Union High School District, and 6th grade Washington Elementary.
Why I TeachI have always wanted to be a teacher. I started school in first grade. The minute I walked in the classroom, I decided I would grow up to be a teacher. Mrs. Hanson, my first-grade teacher, was an excellent teacher and kept my dream alive. I worked throughout my school career to reach that goal. It's simple, I love to teach.

ExperienceTwenty years teaching special education, 13 years in resource, and seven years in self-contained.
Why I TeachI teach because children need help learning from a professional that has had the education and experience to do so adequately. Our students today will be the building blocks for tomorrow, and we need to pass down our knowledge of the current academics used in schools to make them the best they can be. Your students will someday thank you for all the work you have done to make their school experience successful.

Borunda JulieJulie Borunda Mentor Send message »   EducationBA Education, MA Curriculum and Instruction
ExperienceTwenty years of experience in education. This is my 19th year at Fowler as a teacher and a mentor.
Why I TeachEver since I can remember, I wanted to be a teacher. When I was a kid, I would play school in my playroom with my friends. We'd take turns being a student and a teacher. Teaching and helping others are part of my life's mission. I love seeing that light bulb moment when a concept comes alive for students! Through learning, we can learn about ourselves and the world around us. I teach to help students find their voice. I teach to inspire students to become the best version of themselves. I teach to empower others to make this world a better place.

Sharbono FrankFrank Sharbono Technology Send message »   EducationAAS Computer Aided Drafting, BAS Computer Aided Manufacturing, MAS Education Media Technology, MAS Computer Information Systems
ExperienceMy work experience prior to teaching is fairly extensive, from paper routes (child and adult), washing dishes, U.S. Army, construction, grocery inventory, grocery produce display, stock clerk, bobtail truck delivery driver, trash truck driver, skip loader driver, cement truck driver, furniture repair/delivery/inventory/stocking with floor display/design, and several years as a circuit board manufacturing engineer, teaching middle school since 2004.
Why I TeachIn my twenties, I started thinking about the how and why of everything, and eventually, I realized that, for the most part, the only reason I didn't know something was simply because I hadn't been taught. Why can that person disassemble and reassemble an engine, and I can't? They were taught, and I wasn't. Sometime later, reflecting, I started to see what I could have done, what I could have been. I then promised myself that my students would get the chances I missed.

Why I Teach"This is why I teach music not because I expect you to major in music, not because I expect you to play or sing all your life, not so you can relax, not so you can have fun, but so you will be human, so you will recognize beauty, so you will be closer to an infinite beyond this world, so you will have something to cling to, so you will have more love, more compassion, more gentleness, more good. In short, more life." ~ author unknown

Hunt CindyCindy Hunt Reading Interventionist Send message »   EducationB.S. Brigham Young University, M.Ed. ASU; Endorsements K–12 in Computer Science, Reading, and SEI (Structured English Immersion)
ExperienceThis is my 30th year of teaching. I've taught grades two through eight and middle school reading intervention. This is my 12th year as the Reading Interventionist at Western Valley Middle School.
Why I TeachI teach because I love it, and I believe in all people. We have a responsibility to teach our children what they need to know to be the most successful in later life. I want them to have plenty of choices for what they do for their work or career when they are older and the ability to keep on learning for their entire lives.

Moreno VincentVincent Moreno Counselor Send message »   EducationB.S. Organizational Studies - ASU   Master Administration - NAU  Master Education School Counselor - NAU
ExperienceThis is my second year as a school counselor. This is my second career. I retired from the City of Phoenix Water Service Department after 22 years. Left as a Water Asset Manager.
Why I TeachI like to let my action speaks louder than words. If you want to see change, you have to be part of that change. I want students to be successful in their life after they have finished their school years. I have seen too many employees fail because they were missing something that they did not learn during their educational years. I like to teach students how to overcome obstacles that are part of life. Every student has the potential to be successful. I enjoy supporting and guiding my students.
