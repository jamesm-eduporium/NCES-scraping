Bio


A Raptor through and through, this is my 11th year at Silver Creek High School!  I have worked in a variety of educational settings which include Campus Supervisor, Teacher at an Alternative High School, Teacher at a traditional high school, Principal of The Manning School and Principal of Silver Creek High School.  Along the way I have coached basketball, led student leadership programs, taught Advanced Placement History, written curriculum, overseen construction projects, expanded curricular offerings, served on numerous school and district level committees.  No job too big or too small you can find me at the Creek most days whether that is assisting students, working with parent organizations, supporting teachers, serving as a crossing guard or plugging away as our webmaster.  The best part of my day is watching our kids reach new heights and contribute positively to the greater community of Silver Creek and beyond.  Celebrating our kids in the classroom, on the court, on the stage, on the pitch, on the field, while serving our community or representing Raptor Nation in all that we do is truly a gift.  Go Raptors!
