Employee Benefits and Resources



USD 261 Benefits
Haysville School District #261 is pleased to provide its employees with a broad spectrum of employee benefits. As an employee of the Haysville School District, you may choose to participate in benefit programs designed to help meet your personal and professional goals. All employees are eligible to enroll in the school district's insurance plans if they are regularly scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week. Depending on your date of hire, coverage typically becomes effective the first month following your date of hire.
Open Enrollment occurs yearly in August; life changing events are the only other times during the Plan Year that you can apply to make changes to insurance benefit coverages. These events include: marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, death, termination or commencement of employment of a spouse. These events open a 30 day window to make an application for changes in coverage. When enrolling or applying for coverage changes, all necessary forms are obtained and processed through the Benefits Department located at the District Office. If you have questions regarding your benefits, please contact Jan Williams at 554-2201.
