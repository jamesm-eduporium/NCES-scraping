Bio


I am honored and blessed to have the privilege to serve as the new principal at Red Hawk Elementary school.  I look forward to forging many positive relationships along the way and working collaboratively with our students, staff, parents and community to continue to develop Red Hawk Elementary school as one of the best schools in the state of Colorado and nationwide.  With a highly effective teaching-team and support staff meeting the needs of every child at RHE, we will continue to set high expectations for self and students alike, approaching every day with a "We Can" approach and "No Excuses" mentality!

My educational philosophy is based on the foundation of my core beliefs that:
  1.  ALL students can learn at high levels
  2.  Positive & Purposeful Collaboration is key
  3.  We must be results oriented, because Results Matter

Personally, I have been married to Dawn (Oelsligle) Garcia for 21 years.  We met while I was serving at the American Embassy in Islamabad Pakistan while in the United States Marine Corps.  We have been blessed with two children.  Our daughter, Madisyn Lee, is beginning her sophomore year at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln where she is studying to become a Speech-Language Pathologist and works for the Husker Athletic Department.  Our son, Briscoe Don-Bruno, is an energetic, personable, and intelligent 2nd grader who will be joining me at Red Hawk Elementary school.  As a family we put a premium on spending time together and exploring the outdoors and all that Colorado has to offer.

Don't hesitate to contact me with any questions, comments, ideas or concerns that your may have.  I will do my best to ensure that every day is a great day at Red Hawk Elementary school!

Sincerely,

Mr. Garcia
