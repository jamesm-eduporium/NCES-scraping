Message from the PrincipalMessage from the Principal


Greetings all:

Cache Creek High School is a very special place. As I tell all of our students, there is a lot of love here. Our staff are here because the want to be and it shows in the relationships we have with our kids. Whatever you may think you know about Cache Creek, we are first and foremost a safe place for kids to learn and grow. We believe our role is in guiding our students become present, positive, and productive, the three markers for students who are successful.
 
If you look at the data from the last 5 years, what we see is that students are successful when they:
 

have a 90% or higher attendance rate,
are positive in their interactions with staff and students,
and earn at least 20 credits per quarter.

 
This formula works… and our staff helps guide students to meet these expectations. Take a look at the following for a bit more: Mission, Self-Directed Learners & School Goals.
 
There is a ton of info on our website, and I won’t repeat it here. However, I would like you to know that we believe very strongly that one of the keys for our students is to increase our students’ “readiness-to-learn.” Throughout the year, we will engage our students with socio-emotional learning (SEL) lessons to help them understand themselves, and build their capacity to interact positively with the world around them.
 
So, look around the website, and please don’t hesitate to give us a call if there is something we can do to help your student be successful.
