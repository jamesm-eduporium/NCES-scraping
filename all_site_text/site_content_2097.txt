Turning 18




RIGHTS OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD STUDENTS RIGHTS OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD STUDENTS 



California education code states that eighteen year old students have the right to verify their own absences and sign any necessary school documents.
 
 
Eighteen year old students should be cautioned that while they may exercise this right, they must also accept responsibilities for absences and adherence to all other school rules.















VotingVoting



If you are a U.S. citizen one of your basic rights is the right to vote.
 
Once you turn 18 you have the right to vote, but you have to register.  In California, you can register to vote by going to the post office and filling out a voter registration form, or you can register online.



Selective ServiceSelective Service



If you are a man ages 18 through 25 and living in the U.S., then you must register with Selective Service. It’s the law. According to law, a man must register with Selective Service within 30 days of his 18th birthday. Selective Service will accept late registrations but not after a man has reached age 26. You may be denied benefits or a job if you have not registered. You can register at any U.S. Post Office and do not need a social security number. 
 
 
If you applied for FAFSA, for financial aid for college,  there is a section of the application process that will ask you about the Selective Service. You must register with Selective Service in order to be eligible for any federal financial aid.  You can register with Selective Service here.
