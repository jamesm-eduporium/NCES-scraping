Counselor Karina Solorzano 
I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself, my name is Karina Solorzano and I am the new school counselor for Sierra High School. I am so happy to be here and be part of the Sierra team.
I have an undeniable passion for school counseling and always knew this was my dream job. What I love most of high school level is the students’ ability to learn more about themselves. This is a great time for students to explore their interests and plan for the future. I am excited to meet and support our students through their journeys.
I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Sociology from Cal State Los Angeles. I then decided to further my education and earned a Master’s degree in Educational Counseling with a concentration in School and Family Based Counseling from the University of La Verne.
As a school counselor, my primary responsibility is to promote academic, personal, and social development for all students. I look forward to offering support to all Sierra students!
