BiographyI  graduated from Montoursville High School in 1994.  I received my BA in Psychology and Education from Lycoming College in 1998.  I went on to earn my Masters Degree in Teaching and Learning from Lock Haven University.
I have been teaching at McCall Middle School for 17 years.
Supplies for 2022-2023 school year for 7th grade Algebraic Concepts:  My math curriculum is taught using both Chromebooks and paper materials.  Students need to have their Chromebooks charged every day and also bring the listed items below.
–1.5-2 in 3 ring binder (It is very important that each student has a binder solely for their math materials.  Some students try to put multiple subject materials in one binder which leads to lost papers.)
-single subject notebook or notebook paper for their binder
–pencils-no pens allowed for we make a lot of mistakes in math
–a TI 30XS calculator or a TI 30Xiis (I do have a classroom set, but it is much more helpful for each student to have their own.  This way they also have it handy for when they are not in my room.)
Optional:  index cards(for math vocabulary terms), highlighter, Expo markers, white board erasers
