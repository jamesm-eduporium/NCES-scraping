    All elementary school ACCESS Numbers connect directly with the school's
    general mailbox. At anytime during the message you can enter the EXTENSION
    number to directly ring the phone OR enter the VOICE number to go directly
    to the person's voicemail box.
  

    Additions, corrections and deletions to the District Directory may be sent
    to the Office Manager at your building. They will then forward the
    information to the Administration Center. (They may be faxed to Vicki Witte
    in the Communications department.) Office Managers who wish to learn how to
    update the directory themselves may contact Vicki Witte.
