Clubs and Activities





At Flagstaff Academy, we offer a number of clubs and activities for all of our students, from student leadership opportunities, to robotics, and more. If your students has a specific area of interest and we don't yet have a club, students are encouraged to present their club idea to staff as new clubs form all the time.
