Staff
Communication between parents, guardians, and our schools is an important factor in the success of our students. Parents and guardians are encouraged to speak with their child’s teacher(s), counselor, and/or case manager with questions related to the classroom and other matters relevant to a student’s educational experience. Should a matter remain unresolved after you have contacted the classroom teacher(s), counselor, and/or case manager, parents and guardians are encouraged to follow the “Chain of Communication.” Respectively, the “Chain of Communication” includes teachers/counselors/CST members, supervisors, assistant principals, principals, and central office administrators. Do not hesitate to contact your child’s school or the appropriate department at the following phone numbers should you need additional support in resolving a situation. 
 
In any school community organization, bypassing levels in the chain of communication often creates additional problems and extends the timeline for resolution. If a parent, guardian, or community member brings a concern to anyone in the chain of communication, out of sequence, the concern should be sent back to the appropriate level of communication to resolve the matter at that level.
