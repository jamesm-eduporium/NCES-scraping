Bio


I grew up in the great state of Utah and I am a Utah Ute. I began my career in 1988 in Mesa, Arizona and this is my 35th year as an educator. My first job was teaching math and social studies at Kino Junior High. I have served as a teacher, assistant principal, and principal at both the middle school and high school levels. I moved to Longmont in 2002 and I have been the principal at Westview since 2007. I am proud to say that this is my 16th school year as Principal at Westview. I believe that we have something special here at Westview and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.
I have two adult children who both graduated from Niwot High School. I love to spend time outdoors camping and fishing. I also love to spend time with my beautiful wife Pam and our two crazy Bernedoodle pups! I am also a BIG Utah Utes and Denver Broncos fan!
