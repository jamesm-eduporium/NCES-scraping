Bio


My name is Stephen Hoel and I am the proud principal here at Blue Mountain Elementary. I grew up in this area and went to elementary and middle school in Mead, CO and high school just across town at Skyline High School. After college (University of Northern Colorado), I got my first job teaching in St. Vrain and have been here in various roles for the last 26 years! My wife Christi and I are mostly empty nesters living in Frederick, CO where we raised our son Camden (24) and daughter Chandler (20). I am a huge CU Buffs fan and spend most of the fall and winter following their various sports teams while filling the spring and summer with as much camping and fishing as I can squeeze in. I absolutely love this work and the opportunity it provides us to be a part of students and families reaching their dreams.
