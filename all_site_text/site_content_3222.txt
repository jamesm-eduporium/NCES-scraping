Due to the adverse impact of Hurricane Beryl on our facilities: lack of power, broken limbs all over and some damages to the high school,  WISD will remain closed tomorrow,  Tuesday July 9, 2024.  However, the maintenance department will be open to commence clean up assignments. 
 



WISD Abundance of Care

Good morning.

All extracurricular activities are cancelled, all offices, campuses, and facilities will be closed.
Some operational staff will be on standby to monitor all district facilities.
Stay safe everyone!
