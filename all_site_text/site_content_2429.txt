CalGrant










WHAT IS A CAL GRANT?WHAT IS A CAL GRANT?


The Cal Grant is a California-specific financial aid allocation that does not need to be paid back. Cal Grant applicants must apply using the FAFSA or CA Dream Act Application by the deadline and meet all eligibility, financial, and minimum GPA requirements of either program. Grants are for students attending Universities of California, California State Universities or California Community Colleges, or qualifying independent and career colleges or technical schools in California.
 
There are three kinds of Cal Grants — A, B and C — but you don’t have to figure out which one to apply for. Your eligibility will be based on your FAFSA or CA Dream Act Application responses, your verified Cal Grant GPA, the type of California colleges you list on your application and whether you’re a recent high school graduate. 
 
Cal Grants are for students who are pursuing an undergraduate degree or vocational or career training, and do not have to be repaid. In addition to meeting the financial criteria and Cal Grant requirements, you must:
 


submit the FAFSA or CA Dream Act Application and your verified Cal Grant GPA by the deadline


be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen or meet AB540 eligibility criteria


be a California resident for 1 year


attend a qualifying California college


not have a bachelor’s or professional degree


have financial need at the college of your choice


have family income and assets below the minimum levels


be enrolled or plan to enroll in a program leading to an undergraduate degree or certificate


be enrolled or plan to enroll at least half time


not owe a refund on any state or federal grant or be in default on a student loan


not be incarcerated


maintain the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards as established by the school. Recipients who do not meet the standards are ineligible for Cal Grant payment and will not use eligibility during the terms they are ineligible for payment.
