GuideHello Falcon Families!
Prairie High School is aligned with the BGPS district goals and is a strong provider of high-quality instruction and strong social-emotional skills for all of our students.  As we continue to offer rigorous Advanced Placement courses, and through our extensive partnerships with CASEE, Cascadia Tech Academy, and Running Start, it is our mission to ensure every student graduates on time and with options.  Our Career Technical Education programs are growing every year, offering students the opportunity to earn college credits while learning career-focused skills.  PHS also offers the ability for students to access some of their six classes online. This is a program that we are working to expand at PHS as we respond to student needs due to the COVID pandemic.  We believe in the abilities of all our students, and our work is to nurture them as members of the global society they belong to, recognizing their place in the shared guardianship of the planet, and to help create a better, more peaceful world.  PHS believes in the humanity of all it’s members, and their well-being physically, emotionally, and emotionally. We accomplish this through our school values of:PreparationRigorous academics, innovation, and life-long learningRespectFor each other and the planetIntegrityBe the best version of yourself in all thingsDeterminationHave the grit to never give up on your aspirations and goalsExcellenceTake pride in what you create and contribute 
Prairie is fortunate to have a strong partnership with our Boosters and parents in the community.  Our success would not be possible without the support and positive impact our families and community partners have on PHS.  We are thankful for the on-going support you all provide.With Prairie PRIDE,Susananh WoehrPrincipal Meet the Administrative Team!
 Susannah Woehr, PrincipalHello Falcon families! I am excited to be returning for my second year as principal of PHS.   I love being in this area, as it is close to home for me.  I’m originally from Hillsboro, OR, but became a Washingtonian after going to college at UW, and beginning my career in education in Seattle, where I got my first position teaching Language Arts in 2006.  My plan was always to return to the Portland area and my family eventually, but I got married, bought a house, and had a child while living in Seattle.  Along that journey, I left the classroom to be a Success Dean in Highline School District, and eventually an Assistant Principal at Renton High School.  Recently, I made the decision to return back to this area so I could be nearer my family.  A desire to stay in Washington led me to Battle Ground, where the vision and goals for this district are so clear and inspiring that as an educational leader, I was overjoyed when I was chosen to be principal for Prairie High School. It is here that I feel I have truly come home!
   Kelly Torrez, Assistant PrincipalHi Falcons!  I am so excited for another year at Prairie HS! This is my 23rd year in education and my 11th year as an administrator.  Prior to being an administrator, I was a Social Studies, Math, and AVID teacher as well as spending several years coaching volleyball, basketball and track and field. I grew up in Tualatin, Oregon, and I studied at Oregon State University (Go Beavs!) where I earned my BA in Social Studies, at Concordia University where I earned my MA in Teaching, and Tarleton State University for my administrative credential.  I’m currently enrolled in a doctoral program to earn a degree in Education Leadership.   I live in Vancouver with my husband, and I LOVE to travel and hope to see as much of the world as I can.  I am looking forward to another great school year and meeting all of you!  Go Falcons!
   Stephanie Watts, Assistant Principal and Athletic Director Hey Falcons!  I am returning to Prairie as the Athletic Director and Assistant Principal.  This will be my 23rd year in education and prior to this role, I have served as Assistant Principal, Principal, and Human Resources Director in the Battle Ground School District.  Prior to administrative work, I was a Physical Education Teacher and Coach in the Washougal School District for 12 years.  I grew up in Eugene, Oregon and  earned my undergraduate degree in Athletic Training and Physical Education from Pacific Lutheran University and my Master’s Degree in School Administration from Washington State University – Vancouver.  I live in Vancouver with my Husband, Scooter – PHS class of ’93 and teacher at Laurin Middle School, our two sons, Eli – PHS graduate of 2022 and Sam – current PHS student.  I look forward to the many opportunities we will have to work together to make our PHS community amazing.  GO FALCONS!
  Darren Fox, Dean for StudentsI am excited for another as your Dean for Students. This will be my second year in Washington, and I’m looking forward to another year of growth and adventures. Prior to working as a Dean, I served for 17 years as a Physics/Chemistry teacher and Departmental Administrator in Philadelphia, PA and Indianapolis, IN. I grew up in Eastern Pennsylvania, earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics from Beloit College in Wisconsin and an M.S.Ed from Indiana University. I am an avid rock climber, and I enjoy reading, playing cards/board games, kayaking, hiking and traveling the world. I am looking forward to an exceptional school year with PHS students and families.
   Erin Thompson, Assistant PrincipalWelcome back Falcons! I am so excited to begin another school year with you as an Assistant Principal here at Prairie. This will be the start of my fifth year at Prairie and my eighth with the Battle Ground Schools. Prior to that, I was a high school teacher in the Vancouver Public Schools at Skyview High School and Columbia River High School where I taught English, Science, Social Studies, Literacy, ELL and ALE for 18 years. I am also a Vancouver native. I grew up here in Vancouver and graduated from Hudson’s Bay High School. I graduated from Western Washington University and Washington State University (GO COUGS!), but ultimately decided to settle here in Vancouver. I am married to my best friend, who is also a high school teacher and Cougar Alumni. We have three children, a freshman daughter, a middle school daughter, and a son who is a junior at WSU-V and who graduated from Prairie in 2019. We also have three Alaskan Malamutes who are silly and ridiculous. I love Prairie! The community of students, staff and families is supportive, inclusive and kind. I am excited to finally have a year that seems normal. There is nothing that makes me happier than seeing students participate in the activities (academics, athletics, activities and clubs) where they feel confident and supported. Welcome back everyone!
