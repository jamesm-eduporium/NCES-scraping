Grants Management




Grants Management and Compliance monitors spending practices to ensure that all expenditures are allowable and aligned with the parameters of approved local, state, and federal grants.
The Grants Management and Compliance team works collaboratively with RPS staff and the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) to foster the execution of federal, state and locally awarded grants. This collaboration between the Local Education Agency (LEA) and the State Education Agency (SEA) supports the timely submission of reports and required documentation to strengthen the compliance and monitoring efforts of Richmond Public Schools.
Below are some of the responsibilities of the Grants Management and Compliance Team:

Train applicable stakeholders on grant development
Develop and maintain standard operating procedures for pre and post grant award phases
Track grant balances, maintains records and corresponds with stakeholders via various modalities
Obtain competitive and formula-based grants from federal, local, and state agencies
Monitor the implementation and expenditure of awarded funds to ensure compliance with state, local and federal parameters of the secured grant.

To learn more, review the OGMC Standard Operating Procedures Handbook (.pdf).
