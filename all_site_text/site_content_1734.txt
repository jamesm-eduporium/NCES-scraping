		Mr. Michael McGinn


Mr. Michael McGinn joined Brentwood Union Free School District as a science teacher and a computer consultant. Now, he is one of the two fantastic Assistant Principals at East Middle School. Mr. McGinn is originally from Rhode Island but has also lived in Illinois and Pennsylvania as well. He attended the University of Florida, where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in biology and a master's degree in education. He taught in Florida for several years before relocating to New York, where he then took time to work in the television industry. Soon after moving to Long Island, he felt passionate about returning to teaching. Then after many years of serving the Brentwood Community as a teacher, he eventually pursued his Administration Degree from Stony Brook University.  
Mr. McGinn works diligently to connect the school with the parents in the Brentwood community. He has developed several programs for both parents and families. Be sure to watch out for announcements about those programs on Parent Square. Mr. McGinn states: “Our philosophy when handling discipline problems is a restorative one. We always include mediation and dialogue when students have conflicts. We have discussions with students about the choices they make and help them make different choices that may be better. I am proud of our teaching staff at East Middle and their commitment to a rigorous and challenging education for our students.  I enjoy working with our families at various events and our family workshops. If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at the school”.

		Mr. Andrew Austin


Mr. Andrew Austin is one of the two wonderful Assistant Principals at East Middle School. He came to Brentwood Union Free School District in 2006 and we have been lucky to have him at East Middle School for the past 17 years. Mr. Austin received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Tuskegee University in Alabama. He then received his Master of Science degree in Administration, from Long Island University (Brooklyn campus). Before he came to Brentwood, he was an Administrator for St. Mary’s Hospital for Children in Bayside, Queens. In March 2023, Mr. Austin announced that he will be retiring at the end of the 2022-2023 school year. Although he will be greatly missed at East Middle, we are all wishing him a happy, healthy, and relaxing retirement. Congratulations Mr. Austin! Wishing you all the best in your next chapter and thank you for all you have done for the Brentwood community.
