Bio


Having the opportunity to work with the great students and staff at Trail Ridge is an honor and I am excited to begin my 8th year here. Originally from Southern California, my wife Jenny and I have been here in Longmont for the past 14 years. Our three kids have graduated from Mead HS here in SVVSD and are on to college in California. When not at TRMS, I enjoy spending time with my wife, taking Rooney (my golden retriever) on walks, and cheering on the Pittsburgh Steelers.
