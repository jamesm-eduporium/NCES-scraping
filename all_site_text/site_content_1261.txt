 Family Faculty Organization

 
We encourage parents and community members to get involved at CFSD.
CFSD's Family Faculty Organizations (FFOs) are the parent-teacher support groups that help organize volunteers, coordinate special projects, and raise funds, among other activities. Each school has its own FFO, and the district FFO coordinates activities that affect all schools.
Contact your child's school to learn more about our FFOs.
 















CFSD is committed to making its website accessible to the widest possible audience, including individuals with disabilities. Should any user have difficulty accessing the content of this site, please see Web Accessibility Guidelines for assistance.
