Staff Meeting (follow-up to Faculty Mtg)

July 18 @ 8:00 am – 8:30 am  EDT  





« School Board Meeting – PMHS LGI
Staff Meeting (Faculty Mtg Follow-up) »









In addition to our faculty meeting each month, we would like to invite all of our staff (hourly employees either through PM or STS) to participate in one of our staff meetings held on either at 8:00AM or 2:00PM the Thursday after our scheduled faculty mtg.  We are hoping that by having two opportunities this will allow you to work with your classroom teacher or supervisor so that you are able to attend at a time that works best.
Although attendance is not mandatory, we would love to have you join us during one of the sessions to hear about building updates and upcoming events.
