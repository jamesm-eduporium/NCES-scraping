The vision for Lakes International Language Academy is to deliver a high-caliber education from a global perspective that combines second-language acquisition with a proven inquiry-based learning approach central to the International Baccalaureate program. To that end, we carefully select our faculty to help guide each child's success and the success of the school. All of us share the International Baccalaureate Organization's philosophy that seeks to develop students as internationally minded and active participants in a lifelong journey of learning.
