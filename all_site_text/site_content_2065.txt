Academic Resources
 
 














On Campus ResourcesOn Campus Resources


 
Special Education: Students who have been assessed and who have an Individualized Education Program (I.E.P.) receive instruction and support in Resource Specialist Programs or Special Day Classes.
Student Study Team (SST): Students who are experiencing academic difficulties may be referred for review to discuss academic modifications in the regular education program.
 
Migrant Education Program: The Migrant Ed. Program provides quality supplementary educational and support services and works together with Pioneer High School to maximize the potential of identified migrant students. A student is identified as migrant if he/she is of a migratory agricultural/lumber worker or a migratory fisherman whose family has moved, during the past three years, for purposes of finding temporary or seasonal employment.
 
504 Plan: A student may qualify for a 504 Plan if he/she is disabled, but does not meet the eligibility criteria for Special Education. These students have physical or mental impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities, including learning. 504 Plans are primarily, but not exclusively, implemented in their regular education classroom and contain individualized modifications and/or accommodations designed to provide an education appropriate to the individual needs of the student. 
 
GATE Program: The purpose of the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program is to provide challenging curriculum and instruction to students capable of achieving significantly beyond the level of their chronological peers. Students may be referred by teachers or parents for evaluation for the program. All students are eligible for the nomination process. Formal identification is based on established district criteria. Evaluations are conducted annually. Each site has a GATE Coordinator, who may be contacted for information about the program.
 
School Attendance Review Team (S.A.R.T): Students who have received their third truancy letter may be referred for review to discuss ideas that may help them to get to school and class on time. Parents and students will meet with Pioneer High School staff to establish a plan to prevent any further attendance problems.
