Bio


Welcome to Our School! I am delighted to serve as the principal of Prairie Ridge. I have called this wonderful community of Firestone my home since 2009 and am proud to live in the school neighborhood. This deep connection makes me highly vested in our school's success and the growth of our students.Since becoming principal in 2021, my goal has been to grow learners and leaders through a strong sense of community and caring. By fostering family partnerships, working alongside our dynamic staff, and ensuring high student engagement, we provide instruction tailored to meet the unique needs of every student.Before stepping into the principal role, I had a fulfilling career as a teacher, literacy specialist, instructional coach, and dean of students. My educational background includes an Associate's degree in Communications, a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts, and a Master's degree in Educational Leadership.As a parent of five grown children who now live in other states, I find great joy in coming to school each day, immersing myself in the laughter and learning of our students. In my free time, I love diving into fantasy books and movies, traveling to visit family, and exploring our beautiful state of Colorado.I firmly believe in the power of family and education to positively impact children, nurturing them into responsible and productive citizens. I look forward to partnering with you to create a thriving educational environment for our students. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to speak to an administrator.
