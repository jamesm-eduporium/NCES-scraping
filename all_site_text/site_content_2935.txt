  Principal's CornerWelcome to DCHS












 On behalf of the faculty and staff at Dale County High
 School, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our school’s website.  Dale
 County High School has established many incredible traditions and 
legacies throughout the years.  I sincerely hope you will take the time 
to look throughout our web pages and enjoy the numerous opportunities 
available to all the students who are part of our Warrior family.  We 
believe our students’ years at Dale County will be their opportunity to 
be a ‘Scholar and a Champion’in whatever endeavor they undertake – and 
we are very proud of everyone’s accomplishments. Our goal as educators is to teach content, skills, and behaviors for 
the present and future benefit of all students and the entire 
community.  We will make every effort so all students graduate ready for
 college and career – and be able to succeed in the increasingly complex
 world in which they will live and work.  The incredible faculty and 
staff at Dale County High School continue to encourage all students to 
set high goals for themselves and to reach for their dreams. Thank you for visiting our website and I am confident that you will see many parts of the proud Warrior tradition.  Go Warriors!!!
