We are proud to be part of a small community filled with rich traditions.Indian Creek prides itself on providing students a caring and supportive environment and serving our community by delivering well-prepared, responsible graduates. With just over 140 students in each grade (9-12), Indian Creek has that small-town feel that so many in the community love. As a school with the “rural advantage,” we can offer smaller class sizes where students can get the personal attention they deserve; more opportunities for students to participate in more kinds of activities (e.g., athletics, drama, musicals and other extracurricular activities); and with a 18:1 student-to-teacher ratio, teachers are able to be more flexible in response to individual students and their circumstances.I am confident that you will find that the opportunities available to our students while attending ICHS will prepare them well for their future, whatever that may hold. It’s a great day to be a Brave!VIEW DIRECTORYSAT SCHOOL DAY MARCH 6Indian Creek High School will participate in the state-mandated SAT School Day on Wednesday, March 6, 2024. Juniors must make every effort to be in school on this day. All freshmen, sophomores and seniors will have an e-learning day.
