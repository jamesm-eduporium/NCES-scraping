Non-Homestead Operating Millage Proposal




Thornapple Kellogg Schools is located largely in northwestern Barry County and southern Kent County.  We are home to the Thornapple River, acres of state land, and numerous inland lakes.  The community offers a quiet, rural place to call home with convenient access to the Greater Grand Rapids Metropolitan area.  A great place to call home.
