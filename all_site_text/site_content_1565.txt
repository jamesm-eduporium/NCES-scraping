GAGGLEGAGGLE







The Gaggle Safety Management for G Suite service combines technology with expert safety representatives, who review content 24/7 to assure students are safe. The service uses a computer algorithm to identify words, phrases and images of concern in all students’ PVUSD G Suite online resources. Content in students’ G Suite is then reviewed by the safety representatives for questionable content.  Depending on the severity of the item, the Gaggle representative will contact the school administration to alert them to the issue and for positive intervention follow up as necessary.  Gaggle is not used to monitor devices (personal nor PVUSD devices).  Students’ PVUSD Google Drives are monitored by Gaggle.  Their social media, emails, text messages, and devices are not monitored by Gaggle.
