Sarah Tanikawa
Principal
 




 
  Mrs. Tanikawa has worked in the Tustin Unified School District for 5 years and has served in public education for more than 19 years.  Prior to joining Hewes, Mrs. Tanikawa served five years as the Assistant Principal at Beckman High School.  Mrs. Tanikawa oversaw curriculum and instruction and is a leader dedicated to supporting teachers, staff, and students. 
  As the assistant principal at Beckman High School, Mrs. Tanikawa led the work to establish a comprehensive school counseling program, developed Dual Enrollment processes, grew the Career Tech Pathway programs expanding both photography and applied medical pathways. Mrs. Tanikawa’s background at the high school level allows her to support our students in getting on the right path to becoming successful high school students, graduates, and lifelong learners.

  Mrs. Tanikawa believes that great schools result from the collaborative efforts of students, parents, teachers, and staff. She feels her primary goal is to continue to provide the Hewes team with the tools they need to help students grow and learn. Mrs. Tanikawa’s priority is to understand who we are as a Highlander community and to build upon the great work that is taking place at Hewes.
  Outside of school, Mrs. Tanikawa is a mother of two boys and has an amazing and supportive husband. Her oldest son is a sophomore in college and her younger son is a senior in high school.  As a family, they are highly involved in outdoor activities and spending time staying active and healthy.
 "I am thrilled to be joining the Highlander community with such a rich past”, said Mrs. Tanikawa.  “I look forward to working with the staff, students, parents, and community as we continue to build our bold future together.”

Anjali Sheth
Counselor: Last Names A - La
asheth@tustin.k12.ca.us
             
  I am an Orange County native and I feel so lucky to be serving the Hewes Middle School community this year. I earned my bachelor’s degree from Cal State Fullerton, and from there I pursued teaching which led me to school counseling. I recently graduated from Chapman University with a master’s degree in counseling. I have been fortunate enough to work with students from grades K - 12, however I have always found the most joy in working with middle schoolers.
 I have been a student and I am also a parent, so I understand the ups and downs of life in and outside of school. I am here to support our students and their families to the best of my ability. I am looking forward to learning and growing with you all! Cheers to a wonderful year ahead.
With gratitude,
Anjali Sheth









Alexis Jimenez
 Counselor: Last Names Le - Z
      aljimenez@tustin.k12.ca.us
 
 I am grateful to join the Hewes team! This will be my first year at Hewes Middle School and living in Southern California. I relocated from Sonoma County over the summer with my wife and one year old son. I attended UC Santa Cruz for my bachelor’s degree and San Jose State University for my Master’s degree. I have worked as a high school counselor for the past three years and am excited to work with middle school students again. 
 I believe in a holistic approach to school counseling and supporting students to develop resiliency, coping skills, and soft skills for long term success. I look forward to working with our students and families, and the larger Hewes community. Let’s make it a great year!
Sincerely
Alexis Jimenez
