EASE provides confidential counseling, phone consultations and community referrals.







EASE counselors specialize in:

family troublesemotional distressdrug/alcohol problemsjob anxieties and stressgrief, loss and transitions
EASE is primarily an assessment and brief counseling service and is best defined as a pre-treatment service. The emphasis is on early identification of problems affecting work performance, consultation with managers, labor representatives, employees and proactive intervention. EASE is not a substitute for a district’s health-care plan. It is, however, a beneficial and effective extension of the provider plan.
