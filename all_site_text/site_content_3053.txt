Aird, Molly 
4K Teacher
airdm@fonddulac.k12.wi.us




Visit my 4k Facebook Page!  My name is Molly Aird and I am so blessed to be a part of the Fond du Lac School District!! This will be my eleventh year teaching 4K with the Fond du Lac School District and my second year joining Lakeshore Elementary and Christian Parents for Kids. I graduated from Marian University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Early Childhood/Elementary Education and a Masters in Educational Technology.In our 4K program, my ultimate goal is for the children to love learning and school. I embrace the whole child and very consciously provide a balanced program. We build both Social/Emotional and academic skills all year long I encourage them to be independent, self-reliant, and socially adapt at their developmental level. We play, we learn, we grow every single day!! I look forward to another amazing year!!
