Public Comment
The Shelby County Board of Education is committed to its mission of preparing all students for success in learning, leadership,
and life. The Board, which governs the business operations of Shelby County Schools, is comprised of nine
(9) elected officials, representing all county districts.
Regular Business Meetings of the Shelby County Board of Education are held at the Francis E. Coe Administration Building, 160
S. Hollywood Street, at 5:30 p.m. on the final Tuesday of each month. Members of the public are invited to speak with the Board
at Business Meetings during the Public Comment section of the agenda. The Board holds Work Sessions on Tuesdays one week
prior to all regular business meetings.
As part of our commitment to keeping our community informed, all Shelby County Board of Education Work Sessions and Business
Meetings are open to the public and streamed live online and broadcast live on Cable 19 and 88.5 FM.





Time is set aside at each regularly-scheduled Board Business meeting to allow Shelby County residents, businesses/organizations or District employees to address the Board. The sign-up period begins thirty (30) minutes prior to each regular Business and/or Special Called Meeting.

CONSTITUENT SERVICES
The Board Office assists parents and the community in communicating concerns to Board members. Parents are encouraged to seek resolution at the school level through the appropriate staff member. In addition, Memphis-Shelby County Schools is equipped with Parent Liaisons at the Parent Welcome Center, who are trained to support parents in resolving issues and concerns. The Parent Welcome Center is located at 2687 Avery Avenue, and can be reached at 901-416-5300.

CONTACTING THE BOARD
Because Board Members are
elected officials rather than District
employees, they do not have
individual offices at the District’s
Central Office. However, you can
mail correspondence to Board
Members at 160 S. Hollywood. Any
correspondence sent to Central
Office will be delivered to the Board
at their next scheduled meeting.
