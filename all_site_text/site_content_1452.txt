Junior FAQsJunior FAQs



What subjects are required in the Junior year?
English
Math
20th Century US History or AP US History
3 Electives
* Students with an Individual Education Plan may have a slightly different plan.
 
How many credits does a student need to be considered a junior?
110 and above
 
How is a student classified if they have less than 110 credits?
They would be classified as either a third year Freshmen or a second year Sophomore.  
 
How can a student make up deficient credits?
If the deficient credits are in a required course, attend summer school to earn the missing credits, take an after school intervention class, or enroll in an equivalent class at Woodland Community College,
 
Why should a student take the PSAT?
The benefit of the PSAT, in addition to National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (NMSQT) for juniors is the opportunity to take a test very similar to the SAT that will not show up on the SAT score report. The PSAT is like a scrimmage-it doesn't count, but you get test practice and score feedback that should help to plan for the SAT.
 
While the SAT is no longer a requirement for admission for CSUs and UCs, out of state schools and private colleges still use the SAT as part of their admission process. For more detailed information, see the Academic Assessments page in the College planning section
 
What is the ASVAB Test?
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) gives students a unique opportunity to learn about their interests and aptitudes in a variety of job related skills. Sponsored by the Armed Forces, the test is used in their recruiting programs. However, the student faces no obligation because of taking the test. For more information see the Military Service page in the Career planning section.
