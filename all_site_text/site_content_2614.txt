TSC Outdoor WiFi Options





To support remote and virtual learners who may have issues accessing high speed internet, the TSC has installed an outdoor WiFi antenna at each of its elementary and middle schools. The same solution will be installed at the high schools during upcoming renovations. 
The TSC has partnered with Wintek/Tipmont to offer free, public WiFi at four of the outdoor Wifi locations (Klondike Elementary, East Tipp Middle, Southwestern Middle, and Wainwright Middle). This interactive map shows Wintek's public WiFi offerings throughout the region. At these locations, the TSC WiFi networks are available (TSC account required) as well as Wintek's free Wifi Network (no account required). The other 14 locations are only broadcasting the TSC WiFi networks (no free public option). 

To access the outdoor WiFi options, patrons can drive their car near the locations identified on the maps linked below. For the free public options, users will connect their device to the “Free Wintek WiFi” signal. Patrons must agree to Wintek's terms of use before connecting and should treat this with the same caution as any other public internet connection. Use care when connecting to any websites that require a password or personal information. This includes social networking sites, online banking services or any websites that store your credit card information.
To access the TSC WiFi networks, a student or staff username and password is required. Users of these networks are subject to the TSC's Acceptable Use Policies.
Users are strongly encouraged to practice social distancing measures when using the outdoor WiFi at these locations.
