Unique to Mesquite ISD, the ETIP program is the first of its kind created to recruit, retain, differentiate and reward the most talented and dedicated classroom teachers. Faced with a nationwide teacher shortage, MISD developed the ETIP program to develop teachers’ expertise through targeted, specified professional development that adds value to the district. Through ETIP, these master teachers can substantially improve their financial future while staying in the classroom.
For more details about the ETIP program, click here or contact the Professional Learning Department at 972-882-7737.
Teachers are eligible to apply for the ETIP program after two years of employment with Mesquite ISD.






Need to Know in 90 Videos






We have created a video series specifically for our first year teachers.  The series is called “Need to Know in 90.”  

Each video is approximately 90 seconds long
Content centered around the needs of a first year teacher (Classroom management, Building positive relationships with families and students, Powerful instructional strategies, Technology resources, Organizational tips, etc.)
Teachers and staff from across our district are featured in each of the videos.

The video series can be found at the following link:  Need to Know in 90 Playlist






New Teacher Academy





Teachers who are new to the profession will attend on-going support and learning from fellow teachers across our district. Time is given to connect, de-brief, and reflect with other first and second year teachers who are experiencing the same successes and challenges. Classroom environment, classroom management, building relationships, effective instructional strategies, engagement and motivation, and teacher self-care are just a few of the topics that are covered over the course of our 2-year New Teacher Academy.  
You will receive more information about the details and requirements of our district New Teacher Academy during the week of New Hire Orientation.






New Hire Orientation





Mark your calendars for MISD's New Hire Orientation on July 24 - 27, 2023 (8:00 am-4:00 pm).  All new hires are required to attend. 
All new hires will attend up to four days of training.  Your schedule will depend on your years of experience and job assignment.  You will receive your New Hire Orientation schedule when you arrive on the first day.

Register for MISD Professional Learning (Eduphoria/Strive)





Mesquite ISD provides high quality professional learning in many ways.  Occasionally you will be required to attend staff development either on your campus or at another location in the district during your contract hours. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to choose workshops from our Professional Learning Catalog that you would like to attend.  These workshops will be held after contract hours either face-to-face or online. 
Catalog
To assist you in building your professional knowledge and skills, the Professional Learning department publishes an online catalog of workshops to be offered each semester. The catalog contains a variety of classes for all instructional interests and needs.  Employees will receive an email each semester containing a link to the upcoming catalog of classes.  You can always find the current catalog posted on our MISD portal (look for the Professional Learning Catalog app). 
How to Register (Eduphoria)
The link to register for courses can be found in the Professional Learning catalog under the description of each course.  Each course has it's own unique link to register.  The link will take you to our Eduphoria (Strive) system to register for the course.
After you have successfully completed the classes you registered for in Eduphoria, you'll be paid $7.50 per hour of class (will be found on your January or June paycheck).  In MISD, we refer to this as Pay for Knowledge, or PFK. Classes are a minimum of three hours.
Tips for Success

While the Eduphoria system contains basic course information, you should always read the full course description in the published catalog to make sure the course is appropriate for your needs.
If you learn that you cannot attend a course, use the Eduphoria system to un-enroll from a scheduled class as soon as you learn that you won't be in attendance. This allows someone else to enroll in your place and keeps you from having a no-show designation on your transcript.
Credit for classes is awarded for completion of all course activities and full attendance; partial credit is not given.
Your transcript of completed classes can be found in Eduphoria.







State of Texas Professional Learning Requirements





According the Texas Education Agency, Continuing Professional Education (CPE) is required for all Texas educators holding a standard certificate. If you received a standard certificate in Texas after September 1, 1999, you must renew it every five years. You must earn a minimum number of CPE hours through an approved CPE provider to renew your certificate.  Professional learning hours provided or required by MISD may be used towards this state expectation.
Renewal Requirements:
Continuing professional education (CPE) is required to renew a standard certificate. Your certificate will be set to inactive status if you do not renew by the expiration date. CPE hours are required, even if your certificate has already been set to inactive status. Certificates cannot be renewed by completing examinations. 

Classroom teachers must complete 150 CPE hours.
	
No more than 150 CPE hours are required, even if you hold multiple classroom certificate areas.


If you hold an administrative and/or student services certificate you must complete 200 CPE hours.
	
No more than 200 CPE hours are required, even if you hold multiple certificates, such as: classroom, administrative and student services certificates. 



You must maintain written documentation of all CPE required activities.  Acceptable documentation may be certificates of completion or a professional development transcript.  The documentation does not have to be submitted at the time of certificate renewal; however, it must be submitted to TEA in case of a certificate audit.
More Information on Certification Renewal
 






T-TESS Training and Certification






If you are a new teacher, or a teacher new to the T-TESS appraisal system, you must complete an online T-TESS orientation to familiarize yourself with the state-approved appraisal system adopted by our district.
This required course includes 6 modules. The course will take approximately 4 hours to complete, and an estimate of the time required for each module is indicated on the website. Each module will ask you to answer a question and submit a response. It is important that you use the same email address to complete all six of the modules.

Health Insurance Enrollment for New Hires  (Medical, Life, Dental, Vision, etc.)





When do I enroll?
All new employees must complete benefits and insurance enrollment (or deny coverage) within 31 days of your "Date of Hire".
For the purpose of benefits enrollment "Date of Hire" or DOH is the first day you report for work not the date you were hired or signed your contract.
The 31 day clock starts on the first day you report for work.
If you fail to enroll in benefits within the first 31 calendar days from your first day of work you will not have any coverage for the current plan year. 
When Does Coverage Start?
Insurance coverage becomes effective on the first day of the month that follows a waiting period of 30 calendar days.
For example, if your first day to report to work is: 

August 1 = insurance will become effective on September 1
August 2 = insurance will become effective on September 1
August 3 = insurance will become effective on October 1 (because the 30 day waiting period starting on Aug. 3 ends ON Sept. 1 so the first day of the FOLLOWING month is Oct. 1)

When do paycheck deductions for coverage start?


Insurance premiums are deducted from your paycheck the same month they occur. For example: if your coverage starts in October premiums will be deducted from your October check(s). Premiums for July coverage are deducted from July paycheck(s), etc.


Benefits enrollment for new hires is online using the benefit portal.

Leave Days





State Personal Days (5 days that accumulate):
Personal Leave State law entitles all employees to five days of paid personal leave per year. Personal leave is available for use at the beginning of the year. A day of personal leave is equivalent to the number of hours per day in an employee’s usual assignment, whether full-time or part-time. State personal leave accumulates without limit, is transferable to other Texas school districts, and generally transfers to education service centers. Personal leave may be used for two general purposes: non-discretionary and discretionary.
Non-discretionary:  Leave taken for personal or family illness, family emergency, a death in the family, or active military service is considered non-discretionary leave. Reasons for this type of leave allow very little, if any, advance planning. Non-discretionary may be used in the same manner as state sick leave.
Discretionary:  Leave taken at an employee’s discretion that can be scheduled in advance is considered discretionary leave. An employee wishing to take discretionary personal leave must submit a written request to his or her principal or supervisor at least five days in advance of the anticipated absence. Requests for discretionary leave shall be considered in the order in which they are received. The effect of the employee’s absence on the educational program or department operations, as well as the availability of substitutes, will be considered by the principal or supervisor. Discretionary use of leave shall not be allowed on the first or last instructional day, the day before a school holiday, the day after a school holiday, days scheduled for end-of-semester or end-of-year examinations, days scheduled for state-mandated assessments, or professional or staff development days (these days are called Blackout Days). Any discretionary use of leave on these days shall result in deduction from the employee’s pay commensurate with the amount of leave taken. Discretionary use of state personal leave shall not exceed five consecutive workdays.
Local Personal Days (3 days that accumulate):
Professional employees shall earn three paid local personal leave days per school year. Local personal days will be cumulative. These days shall be used according to the terms and conditions of state personal leave. 
Tenure Days:
After all available state and local leave days have been exhausted, a full-time employee shall be granted in a school year a number of days of tenure leave based on years of service, in accordance with administrative regulations. The use of tenure leave need not be in consecutive workdays. Tenure leave may be requested for the employee’s personal illness or injury (including pregnancy related), or for absences related to the illness or injury of the employee’s immediate family if the employee provides medical certification of the need for leave to care for the family member. With appropriate documentation, an employee may also use tenure leave within the first year after a child’s birth, adoption, or foster placement. The average daily rate of a substitute (or a proportionate amount established by personnel classification) shall be deducted for each day of tenure leave taken, whether or not a substitute is employed.  Must be requested by the employee using an Eduphoria leave request.
Sick Leave Bank (or Pool)-OPTIONAL:
The Mesquite Education Association (MEA) maintains and governs a sick leave bank that employees may join through contribution of local personal leave. Leave contributed to the bank shall be solely for the use of participating employees. A member may request leave from the bank if the employee experiences a catastrophic illness or injury and has exhausted all paid leave.  An employee is required to contribute a local personal day in order to join the sick leave bank.






 Personal Computer Buy Program





Each fall, employees have the opportunity purchase a PC or Mac computer from the district’s vendors at the district's cost. Payment may be made monthly over a two-year period through payroll deduction. No interest is charged. Employees with one year or more of employment are eligible for this benefit. 
All employees will receive an email containing eligibility, pricing, and ordering information in October.
