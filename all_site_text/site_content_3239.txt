Corcoran Joint Unified School District is committed to providing a safe school environment where all individuals in education are afforded equal access and opportunities. The District’s academic and other educational support programs, services, and activities shall be free from discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying of any individual based on the person’s actual or perceived age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, immigration status, marital or parental status, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation; the perception of one or more of such characteristics; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. Specifically, state law prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in enrollment, counseling, and the availability of physical education, athletic activities, and sports. Corcoran Joint Unified School District assures that lack of English language skills will not be a barrier to admission or participation in District programs. The Uniform Complaint Process investigates complaints of unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying. Such complaints must be filed no later than six months after knowledge of the alleged discrimination was first obtained. For questions or complaints, contact Section 504, Title IX Coordinator - Helen Copeland (559) 992-8888, ext.1248.
