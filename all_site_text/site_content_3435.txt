California Colleges Guidance Initiative (CCGI)














The California College Guidance Initiative (CCGI) works to ensure that all 6th-12th grade students in California have access to a systematic baseline of guidance and support as they plan, prepare, and pay for post-secondary education and training.
CCGI has two overarching objectives:
 
 


All high school seniors graduate with a thoughtful, well-informed, post-secondary plan.


Students' academic transcript, unique identifier, and college and career planning data follow them in a manner that reduces information gaps that hinder student success.






WHAT IS CCGI?
CaliforniaColleges.edu is an interactive website designed to help your child plan and prepare for college and career.
When signed in, students can:


Complete grade-level appropriate activities designed to guide him or her toward a college and career plan that matches his or her goals and interests.


Find and favorite careers, colleges, and majors.


Plan high school courses and track progress toward completion of “a-g” course requirements, as well as CSU and UC eligibility.


Apply to colleges and track submissions.


Launch the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or California Dream Act Application (CADAA).


Store resumes, college application essays, and other important documents.


When signed in, parents can:


View their child’s activity on CaliforniaColleges.edu and monitor their child’s progress.


Learn valuable information to support their child through the career exploration, college and financial aid planning, and application processes.

CCGI TOOLS AND FEATURES
CaliforniaColleges.edu makes it easy to create and follow an academic plan that will help your child become college and career ready.
 
CCGI FEATURES
The Academic Planner provides an overview of courses your child has taken and allows your child to plan future courses. Based on your child’s goals, he or she may choose to take College Preparatory (P or CP) courses, more advanced Honors (H) courses, or Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, which could qualify for college credit. Many high schools also offer non A-G courses that count toward graduation requirements and may have other benefits to your child.


Currently if students wish to utilize the CaliforniaColleges Academic Planner they will need to manually enter all their courses. We currently build Academic Plans with our students in Aeries and students can check their A-G status there.


 
 
The CSU and UC Eligibility Tools help make sure your child is on track to meet the minimum requirements for admission to a California State University (CSU) or a University of California (UC). These tools use course information from your child’s school to track the following:


Your child’s progress toward meeting A-G Subject Area requirements. A green checkmark means your child has met the requirement for a specific subject area, such as Math (area “c”).


Your child’s unofficial CSU or UC Grade Point Average (GPA). Your child must earn a C- or better in all “a-g” courses. CSU requires a minimum 2.0 GPA, while UC requires a minimum 3.0 GPA. However, admitted students generally have GPAs that are much higher than the minimum requirement.




The target icons quickly tell whether or not your child is on track to meet eligibility requirements, assuming he or she completes all in-progress courses with a C- or better.
