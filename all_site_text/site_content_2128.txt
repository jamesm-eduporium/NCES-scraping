Graduation RequirementsGraduation Requirements


A minimum of 200 credits must be earned in grades 9-12 in the following required courses. Not all courses at CCHS are UC/CSU A-G, which means that while the CCHS diploma is a regular high school diploma, the courses do not meet the requirements for acceptance into the University of California or California State University. Students from CCHS typically attend a community college before attending a four-year university.
