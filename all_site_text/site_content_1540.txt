Bio


Welcome to Central Elementary. I am thrilled to be the principal of this beautiful school with all its history and kind community of learners. Many generations of families have found Central their child's first school. Our experienced staff make Central an engaging and inviting place to learn and grow. The IB Primary Years program allows students to study and learn about themselves as well as the world around them. 
 
I have been in education for 38 years, 20 as a teacher and 18 as a principal in Aurora and Denver Public Schools. My diverse experiences give me a good perspective on how to develop systems and structures in schools that  help children learn and develop their full potential. I have one grown daughter that lives in Denver. I enjoy skiing, reading and gardening when I am not at work. I appreciate the opportunity to serve the Central community.
