Bio


I am absolutely thrilled and honored to begin my 10th year at the proud principal of Mountain View Elementary. You have joined an incredible community of parents, students, teachers and staff.
 
I have taught various levels in elementary throughout the United States. In addition, I have served as an assistant principal at both the middle school and high school level. My passion and heart is in elementary education and I am incredibly fortunate to be apart of Mountain View Elementary.
 
Colorado has been home to me for 22 years. I enjoy spending time outdoors, exploring, traveling and laughing with family and friends. I have three children, the youngest is off to college this year! New adventures await for all of us.
