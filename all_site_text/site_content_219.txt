 Indicates a new alert
IC Messaging to End 7/1 
Cardinal Families, 
This is a reminder that on July 1st, Infinite Campus messaging will no longer be NCSD's communication platform. Infinite Campus will still be what families use to register students, pay fees, check grades, etc. ParentSquare is replacing communication only. 

You can find instructions to access ParentSquare & personalize your preference settings here. You do not have to download the app to receive communications, however, doing so will allow for two way communication & a more versatile experience.
Please contact me if you have any questions or need help, sorensonk@newton.k12.ia.us.
Have a great day!
