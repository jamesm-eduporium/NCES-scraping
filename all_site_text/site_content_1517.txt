 Classroom ConnectionsEffective communication is essential for building school-family partnerships. Parents benefit from being involved in their children's education by getting ideas from school on how to help and support their children, and by learning more about the school's academic program and how it works. At Miller, we appreciate the important role parents play in their children's education. Feel free to contact your child's teacher on anything from:

*Classroom learning activities
*Your child's accomplishments
*How you can help at home with learning
*Questions or concerns
