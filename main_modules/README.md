## Main Modules
There exist five seperate scripts in the main modules directory. As previously mentioned, these each take an input and generate an output, as if they were a digital assembly line. Their main fault is their lack of final results generated. Since the page stores the HTML content, it is very difficult to "link" any names, titles, or other data to a particular email. It is rather simple to just find emails, but beyond that it can't do much, especially if the page is dynamically loaded.

That means that these modules simply generate emails, and honestly a relatively small number of them at that. However, they are important because not only do they actually find staff directories, but provide the resources necessary for the fs_pages to _actually_ get some valuable data. Without these modules, no data would be gained at all! Feel free to check out the individual scripts for a more in depth description of each one.

- [Module 1](1_nces_urls.py)
- [Module 2](2_school_urls.py)
- [Module 3](3_directory_urls.py)
- [Module 4](4_staff_data.py)
- [Module 5](5_compile_data.py)
